A  Price  is  a  Social  Thing:  Towards  a  Material  Sociology  of  Arbitrage  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840606065923  
Patterns  of  trust  and  information  exchange  among  known  others  are  thus  consequential,  and  
arbitrage
 
also
 
has
 
wider
 
social
 
aspects,

Business  Model  Responses  to  Digital  Piracy  –  Paolo  Aversa,  Andres  Hervas-Drane,  
Morgane
 
Evenou
 
(2019,
 
California
 
Management
 
Review
 
[B]
):
 This  study  examines  how  firms  adapt  when  consumers  use  unlicensed  channels  (e.g.  P2P  
networks)
 
to
 
bypass
 
content
 
restrictions.
 
A
 
key
 
insight
 
is
 
that
 
users
 
prize
 
free,
 
on-demand
 
access
 
to
 
huge
 
catalogs
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
“bypass
 
release
 
windows
 
and
 
geographical
 
restrictions
 
in
 
commercial
 
distribution”.
 
The
 
authors
 
note
 
that
 
despite
 
legal
 
actions
 
against
 
Napster
 
and
 
Grokster,
 
open
‐
source
 
P2P
 
networks
 
flourished,
 
and
 
even
 
today
 
“users
 
are
 
rerouting
 
their
 
Internet
 
traffic
 
to
 
bypass
 
monitoring,
 
with
 
virtual
 
private
 
networks
 
(i.e.,
 
VPN)
 
flourishing”.
 
In
 
response
 
to
 
these
 
pressures,
 
innovative
 
entrants
 
like
 
Spotify
 
and
 
Netflix
 
redesigned
 
their
 
business
 
models:
 
they
 
offer
 
large
 
licensed
 
catalogs
 
via
 
subscription
 
(including
 
free/ad
 
tiers)
 
and
 
consumer
‐
friendly
 
streaming
 
on
 
any
 
device.
 
For
 
example,
 
Aversa
 
et
 
al.
 
show
 
that
 
Spotify’s
 
subscription
 
model
 
provides
 
an
 
“all-you-can-eat”
 
content
 
menu
 
that
 
directly
 
matches
 
the
 
appeal
 
of
 
piracy,
 
and
 
that
 
its
 
free
 
tier
 
“further
 
erodes
 
the
 
comparative
 
attractiveness
 
of
 
digital
 
piracy”.
 
Incumbent
 
studios
 
responded
 
by
 
improving
 
convenience
 
(shorter
 
release
 
windows,
 
simultaneous
 
launches)
 
and
 
user
 
experience,
 
but
 
as
 
one
 
executive
 
notes,
 
the
 
key
 
is
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
customer
 
experience
 
to
 
rival
 
with
 
piracy”
 
e.g.
 
Netflix
 
aimed
 
to
 
be
 
“everywhere,
 
just
 
like
 
piracy”.
 
This
 
paper
 
illustrates
 
a
 
business
‐
model
‐
innovation
 
perspective:
 
platform
 
firms
 
deploy
 
dynamic
 
capabilities
 
(flexible
 
licensing,
 
analytics,
 
UX)
 
to
 
appropriate
 
value
 
and
 
pressure
 
incumbents
 
to
 
evolve.
  ●  Countering  "Free"  with  "Freemium"  and  Subscriptions:  The  primary  allure  of  
piracy
 
is
 
its
 
lack
 
of
 
a
 
price
 
tag.
 
Spotify's
 
"freemium"
 
model
 
(a
 
free,
 
ad-supported
 
tier)
 
and
 
Netflix's
 
free
 
trials
 
directly
 
compete
 
with
 
this
 
by
 
offering
 
legal,
 
free
 
access.
 
Their
 
core
 
subscription
 
models
 
provide
 
an
 
"all-you-can-eat"
 
experience
 
for
 
a
 
simple
 
monthly
 
fee,
 
which
 
removes
 
the
 
transactional
 
friction
 
of
 
paying
 
for
 
individual
 
items
 
and
 
matches
 
piracy's
 
perceived
 
benefit
 
of
 
a
 
vast,
 
open
 
library.[1]
 ●  Superior  Convenience  and  User  Experience:  Piracy  often  requires  technical  skill,  
involves
 
slow
 
downloads,
 
and
 
results
 
in
 
inconsistent
 
quality.
 
Spotify
 
and
 
Netflix
 
offer
 
instantaneous,
 
high-quality
 
streaming
 
through
 
intuitive
 
interfaces
 
that
 
work
 
seamlessly  across  a  wide  range  of  devices.  This  focus  on  immediate  gratification  and  
ease
 
of
 
use
 
makes
 
them
 
more
 
convenient
 
for
 
the
 
average
 
consumer.[1]
 ●  Enhanced  Content  Discovery  and  Curation:  Pirated  content  is  difficult  to  navigate,  
with
 
discovery
 
being
 
a
 
major
 
challenge.
 
Spotify
 
and
 
Netflix
 
have
 
invested
 
heavily
 
in
 
sophisticated
 
recommendation
 
algorithms
 
that
 
provide
 
personalized
 
content
 
suggestions.
 
This
 
not
 
only
 
helps
 
users
 
find
 
new
 
content
 
but
 
also
 
keeps
 
them
 
engaged
 
with
 
the
 
platform.
 ●  Building  Community  and  Social  Interaction:  Piracy  is  a  largely  anonymous  
activity.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
legal
 
streaming
 
services
 
integrate
 
social
 
features,
 
allowing
 
users
 
to
 
share
 
playlists,
 
see
 
what
 
friends
 
are
 
watching,
 
and
 
engage
 
in
 
discussions.
 
This
 
adds
 
a
 
layer
 
of
 
community
 
value
 
that
 
piracy
 
cannot
 
replicate.[1]
 ●  Global  Access  and  Reduced  Release  Windows:  A  significant  driver  of  piracy  has  
been
 
the
 
delayed
 
release
 
of
 
content
 
in
 
different
 
geographical
 
regions.
 
By
 
negotiating
 
global
 
licensing
 
deals
 
and
 
pushing
 
for
 
simultaneous
 
worldwide
 
releases,
 
Netflix
 
and
 
Spotify
 
reduce
 
the
 
incentive
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
seek
 
out
 
pirated
 
versions.
     “Freemium  vs.  Deterrence:  Optimizing  Revenue  in  the  Face  of  Piracy  Competition”  –  
Wu,
 
Chamnisampan,
 
&
 
Sin
 
(2025,
 
Journal
 
of
 
Business
 
Research
 
[B])
 Wu  et  al.  develop  a  model  of  a  digital  firm  offering  a  core  product  and  add-ons  under  three  
strategic
 
regimes:
 
no
 
action,
 
deterrence,
 
or
 
freemium.
 
They
 
find
 
that
 
heavy
 
deterrence
 
(e.g.
 
strict
 
anti-piracy
 
measures)
 
can
 
backfire
 
by
 
driving
 
users
 
toward
 
pirated
 
copies,
 
especially
 
when
 
piracy
 
penalties
 
are
 
low.
 
Conversely,
 
a
 
freemium
 
model
 
(free
 
basic
 
product
 
plus
 
paid
 
upgrades)
 
often
 
yields
 
higher
 
profit
 
when
 
deterrence
 
is
 
weak.
 
In
 
some
 
cases,
 
taking
 
no
 
action
 
also
 
boosts
 
legitimate
 
adoption
 
by
 
attracting
 
price-sensitive
 
consumers.
 
Wu
 
et
 
al.
 
further
 
show
 
that
 
network
 
effects
 
matter:
 
strong
 
multi-version
 
or
 
multi-product
 
network
 
effects
 
favor
 
freemium
 
strategies.
 
In
 
short,
 
this
 
study
 
uses
 
dynamic
 
capabilities
 
and
 
pricing
 
theory
 
to
 
show
 
that
 
firms
 
may
 
prefer
 
business
 
model
 
innovation
 
(freemium
 
pricing)
 
over
 
strict
 
deterrence
 
to
 
counteract
 
piracy
  “Piracy  in  a  Two-Sided  Software  Market”  –  Rasch  &  Wenzel  (2013,  Journal  of  Economic  
Behavior
 
&
 
Organization
 
[B])
.
 
Using
 
two-sided
 
market
 
theory,
 
this
 
paper
 
models
 
a
 
software
 
platform  serving  both  developers  and  users.  It  shows  that  software  piracy  affects  the  pricing  
structure
:
 
increased
 
protection
 
raises
 
fees
 
charged
 
to
 
developers
 
but
 
has
 
an
 
ambiguous
 
effect
 on  user  priceseconstor.eu.  A  key  insight  is  that  platform  owners  and  software  developers  may  conflict  over  piracy  protection :  one  side  (typically  developers  seeking  high  royalties)  
benefits
 
from
 
stricter
 
DRM,
 
while
 
the
 
other
 
(platform
 
owners
 
seeking
 
more
 
users)
 
may
 
lose
 
revenue.
 
If
 
platforms
 
are
 
compatible
 
(users
 
can
 
multi-home
 
across
 
platforms),
 
this
 
conflict
 
dissipates.
 
This
 
work
 
uses
 
platform
 
strategy
 
and
 
transaction-cost
 
logic
 
to
 
show
 
how
 
business
 
model
 
choices
 
(e.g.
 
degree
 
of
 
openness
 
or
 
DRM
 
enforcement)
 
influence
 
circumvention.
 
It
 
suggests
 
platforms
 
may
 
strategically
 
adjust
 
compatibility
 
or
 
DRM
 
to
 
balance
 
developer
 
incentives
 
versus
 
broad
 
user
 
adoption.
  Does  Piracy  Lead  to  Product  Abandonment  or  Stimulate  New  Product  Development?  –  
Milan
 
Miric,
 
Lars
 
Bo
 
Jeppesen
 
(2020,
 
Strategic
 
Management
 
Journal
 
[A+]
).
 
From
 
a
 
platform
‐
strategy
 
viewpoint,
 
this
 
empirical
 
study
 
examines
 
how
 
mobile
 
app
 
developers
 
react
 
to
 
a
 
major
 
piracy
 
shock
 
on
 
their
 
platform.
 
The
 
authors
 
find
 
that
 
after
 
piracy
 
strikes,
 
developers
 
reduce
 
incremental
 
updates
 
(e.g.
 
bug
 
fixes)
 
but
 
increase
 
investment
 
in
 
new
 
product
 
features
 
or
 
entirely
 
new
 
apps
.
 
In
 
their
 
words,
 
piracy
 
“leads
 
to
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
the
 
release
 
of
 
incremental
 
innovations,
 
such
 
as
 
bug
 
fixes,
 
but
 
does
 
not
 
decrease
 
more
 
substantial
 
revisions.
 
Additionally,
 
it
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 
subsequent
 
new
 
product
 
development”.
 
In
 
other
 
words,
 
firms
 
reallocate
 
their
 
development
 
efforts
 
under
 
digital
‐
piracy
 
pressure
 
–
 
a
 
classic
 
dynamic
‐
capabilities
 
response.
 
This
 
aligns
 
with
 
platform
 
theory:
 
on
 
a
 
multi
‐
sided
 
digital
 
platform,
 
high
 
piracy
 
shifts
 
the
 
innovation
 
“type”
 
(toward
 
new
 
offerings)
 
even
 
if
 
overall
 
innovativeness
 
is
 
not
 
destroyed.
 
Thus
 
Miric
 
&
 
Jeppesen
 
show
 
that
 
developer
 
firms
 
use
 
the
 
agility
 
and
 
reconfiguration
 
allowed
 
by
 
digital
 
platforms
 
to
 
counteract
 
circumvention
 
threats.

for

In

that

It

that

asymmetric,

For
 
a
 
thesis
 
on
 
geo-arbitrage,
 
this
 
implies
 
that
 
any
 
pricing
 
or
 
service
 
adaptation
 
(e.g.
 
unified
 
versus
 
segmented
 
pricing)
 
must
 
be
 
aligned
 
with
 
local
 
market
 
conditions
 
and
 
regulations.
 
In
 
other
 
words,
 
it
 
highlights
 
that
 
VPN-enabled
 
arbitrage
 
cannot
 
be
 
understood
 
outside
 
the

of
 
cross-border
