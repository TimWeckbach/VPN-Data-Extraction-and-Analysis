Summary Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Operations • We face significant competition and we might not be successful at attracting and retaining users, including through predicting, recommending, and playing content that our users enjoy, or monetizing our products and services including podcasts and other non-music content.
• We face many risks associated with our growth and our international operations, including attracting, retaining and motivating qualified personnel and obtaining rights to stream content on favorable terms.
• Our business emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes long-term user engagement over short-term results.
• Emerging industry trends in digital advertising may pose challenges for our ability to forecast or optimize our advertising inventory, which may adversely impact our Ad-Supported revenue.
• Our major content providers have the ability to unilaterally affect our access to music and other content.
• Difficulties in identifying the compositions in our sound recordings and the ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations under our licenses.
• Interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our own systems or from third parties, such as Google Cloud Platform, could harm our business.
• Failure to effectively manage and remediate attempts to manipulate stream counts and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service could undermine investor confidence.
Risks Related to Our Business Model, Strategy, and Performance If our efforts to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and effectively monetize our products and services are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.
Our ability to grow our business and generate revenue depends on retaining, expanding, and effectively monetizing our total user base, including by increasing the number of subscribers to our premium service (“Premium Service”) and the number of users of our ad-supported service (“Ad-Supported Service”, and together with the Premium Service, the “Service”) and finding ways to monetize content across the Service.
We must convince prospective users of the benefits of our Service and our existing users of the continuing value of our Service.
Our ability to attract new users, retain existing users, and engage active users depends in large part on our ability to continue to offer exceptional technologies and products, compelling content, superior functionality, and an engaging user experience.
Some of our competitors, including Apple, Google, and Amazon, have developed, and are continuing to develop, devices for which their audio streaming services are preloaded or may also be set as the default providers, which puts us at a significant competitive disadvantage.
As consumer tastes and preferences change on the internet and with mobile and other connected products, including cars, in-home, and wearable devices, we will need to enhance and improve our existing Service, introduce new services and features, and maintain our competitive position with additional technological advances and an adaptable platform.
If we fail to keep pace with technological advances or fail to offer compelling product offerings and state-of-the-art delivery platforms to meet consumer demands, our ability to grow or sustain the reach of our Service, attract and retain users, and monetize content across the Service may be adversely affected.
In order to increase our advertising revenue, we seek to increase the listening time that our users spend on our Service or find new opportunities to deliver advertising to users on the Service, such as through podcasts and other opportunities relating to content promotion to users.
The more content users stream on our Service, the more advertising inventory we generally have 6 Table of Contents to sell.
Further, growth in our user base increases the size and scope of user pools targeted by advertisers, which improves our ability to deliver relevant advertising to those users in a manner that maximizes our advertising customers’ return on investment and that ultimately allows us to better demonstrate the effectiveness of our advertising solutions and justifies a pricing structure that is advantageous for us.
If we fail to grow our user base, the amount of content streamed, and the listening time that our users spend on our Service, we may be unable to grow our advertising revenue.
Moreover, given that subscribers to our Premium Service (“Premium Subscribers”) are sourced primarily from converting users of our Ad-Supported Service (“Ad-Supported Users”), any failure to grow our Ad-Supported User base or convert Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers may negatively impact our revenue.
In order to increase our Ad-Supported Users and our Premium Subscribers, we will need to address a number of challenges, including: • providing users with a consistently high-quality and user-friendly experience; • continuing to curate a catalog of content that consumers want to engage with on our Service; • continuing to innovate and keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors; and • maintaining and building our relationships with the makers of mobile and other connected devices.
We face and will continue to face significant competition for users, user listening time, and advertisers.
We face robust and rapidly evolving competition in all aspects of our business, including from companies that allow users to share and discover content and/or that enable advertisers to use content platforms to reach customers, such as Apple, Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Amazon, Facebook, and ByteDance (including TikTok).
These advantages enable them to devote more financial resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing, which in turn enables them to offer competitive services at little or no profit or even at a loss.
For example, prominent, well-funded competitors like Apple, Google, and Amazon have a competitive advantage because they can leverage the substantially broader product offerings in their ecosystem to gain subscribers through bundled offers and to monetize users.
Additionally, our current and future competitors have engaged and will continue to engage in mergers or acquisitions with each other, as SiriusXM and Pandora, or Amazon Music and Wondery, have done, to combine and leverage their broad audiences, content, and capabilities.
Relatedly, we compete for users based on our presence and visibility as compared with other businesses and platforms that deliver audio content through the internet and connected devices.
We face significant competition for users from companies promoting their own digital audio content online or through application stores, including large, well-funded, and seasoned participants in the digital media market.
Device application stores often offer users the ability to browse applications by various criteria, such as the number of downloads in a given time period, the length of time since an application was released or updated, or the category in which the application is placed.
The websites and applications of our competitors may rank higher than our website and our Spotify application in search engines or application stores, and/or our application may be difficult to locate in device application stores, which could draw potential users away from our Service and toward those of our competitors.
In addition, some of these competitors, including Apple, Google, and Amazon, have developed, and are continuing to develop, devices for which their music and/or podcast streaming service is preloaded and/or able to be used out-of- the-box without the need to log in, creating a visibility and access advantage.
If we are unable to compete successfully for users against other digital media providers by maintaining and increasing our presence, ease of use, and visibility, our number of Premium Subscribers, Ad-Supported Users, and the amount of content streamed on our Service may fail to increase or may decline and our subscription fees and advertising sales may suffer.
See “—If our efforts to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and effectively monetize our products and services are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.” We also face increasing competition because of new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions.
Our current and future competitors have introduced, and may continue to introduce, new ways of consuming or engaging with content, such as ByteDance, that cause our users, especially the younger demographic, to switch to another product, which 7 Table of Contents would negatively affect our user retention, growth, and engagement.
As the market for on-demand audio on the internet and mobile and connected devices increases, new competitors, business models, and solutions are likely to emerge.
We believe that companies with a combination of technical expertise, brand recognition, financial resources, and digital media experience pose a significant threat of developing competing on-demand audio distribution technologies.
Additionally, we compete for a share of advertisers’ overall marketing budgets with other content providers on a variety of factors, including perceived return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products and content offering, pricing structure, and ability to deliver large volumes or precise types of advertisements to targeted user demographic pools.
We also compete for advertisers with a range of internet companies, including major internet portals, search engine companies, social media sites, and mobile applications, as well as traditional advertising channels such as terrestrial radio and television.
Large internet companies with strong brand recognition, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter, have significant numbers of sales personnel, substantial advertising inventory, proprietary advertising technology solutions, and traffic that provide a significant competitive advantage and have a significant impact on pricing for reaching these user bases.
In order to attain and maintain profitability, we will need to recruit, integrate, and retain skilled and experienced personnel who can demonstrate our value proposition to users, advertisers, and business partners and who can increase the monetization of the music and podcasts streamed on our Service.
Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our users, effectively monetize the music and podcasts streamed, develop and improve our operational and financial controls, and recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel.
We have experienced rapid growth rates in both the number of active users of our Service and revenue over the last few years.
As we grow larger and increase our user base and usage, we expect it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the rate of growth we currently experience.
Our business emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes long-term user engagement over short-term financial condition or results of operations.
Our business is growing and becoming more complex, and our success depends on our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products.
Our culture also prioritizes our long-term user engagement over short-term financial condition or results of operations.
We frequently make decisions that may reduce our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term.
These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our user growth and engagement, our relationships with advertisers and partners, as well as our business, operating results, and financial condition could be seriously harmed.
If we fail to accurately predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy, we may fail to retain existing users and attract new users in sufficient numbers to meet investor expectations for growth or to operate our business profitably.
We believe that a key differentiating factor between Spotify and other audio content providers is our ability to predict music or podcasts that our users will enjoy.
In addition, our ability to offer users content that they have not previously heard and impart a sense of discovery depends on our ability to acquire and appropriately categorize additional content that will appeal to our users’ diverse and changing tastes.
While we have a large catalog of music and podcasts available to stream, we must continuously identify and analyze additional content that our users will enjoy and we may not effectively do so.
Our ability to predict and select content that our users enjoy is critical to the perceived value of our Service among users and failure to make accurate predictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately attract and retain users, increase content hours consumed, and sell advertising to meet investor expectations for growth or to operate the business profitably.
We have incurred significant costs to license content and continue to pay royalties or other consideration to record labels, publishers, and other copyright owners for such content.
We expect that, in the future, our revenue growth rate may decline because of a variety of factors, including increased competition and the maturation of our business.
We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on: • securing top quality audio and video content from leading record labels, distributors, aggregators, and podcast creators, as well as the publishing right to any underlying musical compositions; • creating new forms of original content; • our technology infrastructure, including website architecture, development tools, scalability, availability, performance, security, and disaster recovery measures; • research and development, including investments in our research and development team and the development of new features; • sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our field sales organization; • international operations in an effort to maintain and increase our member base, engagement, and sales; • capital expenditures that we will incur to grow our operations and remain competitive; and • general administration, including legal and accounting expenses.
Failure to grow our user base and to effectively demonstrate the value of our advertising offerings to advertisers could result in loss of, or reduced spending by, existing or potential future advertisers, which would materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
For example, we experienced a decline in Ad-Supported revenue growth as a result of headwinds to our advertising business during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For example, we need to show that our Service has substantial reach and engagement by relevant demographic audiences.
The impact of these changes on the overall mobile advertising ecosystem, our business, and the developers, partners, and advertisers in the ecosystem are evolving and their ultimate impact is not yet clear.
See “—Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.” Emerging industry trends in digital advertising may pose challenges for our ability to forecast or optimize our advertising inventory, which may adversely impact our Ad-Supported revenue.
Certain advertisers will measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns based on our ability to serve their ads to audiences that match their demographic data benchmarks, and our ability to meet the requirements of these third-party measurement providers may be impacted when we do not have accurate or complete user data.
As these trends in the industry continue to evolve, our advertising revenue may be adversely affected by the availability, accuracy, and utility of analytics and measurement technologies as well as our ability to successfully implement and operationalize such technologies and standards.
For example, we have introduced Streaming Ad Insertion ("SAI") technology to improve our targeting and measurement capabilities for podcast advertising that rely on our streaming capabilities instead of using downloads as a proxy.
However, the impact of the shift in measurement from downloads to real impressions on our advertising revenue is uncertain, as well as its acceptance by our advertising partners or our ability to scale this technology successfully.
These advertising products and programmatic technologies may not integrate with our Service and if we are unable to deploy effective solutions to monetize the mobile device usage by our user base, our ability to attract advertising spend, and ultimately our advertising revenue, may be adversely affected.
Failure to successfully monetize and generate revenues from podcasts and other non-music content could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Delivering podcasts and other non-music content involves numerous risks and challenges, including increased capital requirements, competition, and the need to develop strategic relationships.
Growth in these areas may require additional changes to our existing business model and cost structure, modifications to our infrastructure, and exposure to new regulatory, legal and reputational risks, including infringement liability, any of which may require additional expertise that we currently do not have.
See “—We may be subject to disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our Service.” There is 11 Table of Contents no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue from podcasts or other non-music content to offset the costs of creating or acquiring this content.
Failure to successfully monetize and generate revenues from such content, including failure to obtain or retain rights to podcasts or other non-music content on acceptable terms, or at all, or to effectively manage the numerous risks and challenges associated with such expansion, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed- cost nature of such commitments, if our user growth and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted.
To the extent our user and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of such content commitments.
We provide various services and products that enable artists, podcasters, and other creators or users to make content available on our Service.
For example, creators or users can record and distribute podcasts using Anchor and can upload cover art and profile images.
Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.” Given the large volume of content that various third parties, including record labels, distributors, aggregators, podcasters, live-audio creators, and our users, make available on our platform, it is challenging for us to accurately verify the legitimacy of such content and review or moderate such content to ensure that it is otherwise in compliance with our policies.
We have acquired and invested in, and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in, other companies or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities or content offerings, or otherwise offer growth opportunities.
For example, the majority of our long- term investments relates to Tencent Music Entertainment (“TME”).
Limitations on travel, “stay at home” orders, social distancing requirements, and other governmental actions implemented in response to COVID-19 have caused, and may in the future cause, changes as to how our users consume music and podcasts, and any failure to predict or address such changes in our users’ engagement with our Service could adversely affect our business.
Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream We depend upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
To secure the rights to stream content, we enter into license agreements to obtain licenses from rights holders, such as record labels, aggregators, artists, music publishers, performing rights organizations, collecting societies, podcasters, podcast networks, and other audio/video content creators, copyright owners or their agents, or obtain licenses via government-provided statutory or compulsory licenses, and pay royalties or other consideration to such parties or their agents around the world.
We cannot guarantee that our efforts to obtain all necessary licenses to stream content will be successful, nor that the licenses available to us now will continue to be available in the future at rates and on terms that are favorable or commercially reasonable or at all.
For example, if we fail to obtain licenses to stream sound recordings from major record labels; if the rates we pay for mechanical licenses that are set by the Copyright Royalty Board increase our royalty costs; if we are unable to comply with the requirements to maintain the compulsory mechanical license in the U.S.; if we are unable to obtain blanket licenses for public performance rights on reasonable terms; if our licenses with collecting societies and our direct licenses with publishers outside of the U.S. do not provide full coverage for all of the musical compositions we make available to our users; for podcasts and other non-music content, if rights holders or content providers do not comply with the terms and conditions of our license agreements as well as the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.
See also “—Difficulties in obtaining accurate and comprehensive information necessary to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings on our Service and the ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations under our licenses, affect the size of our catalog, impact our ability to control content acquisition costs, and lead to potential copyright infringement claims.” Even when we are able to enter into license agreements with rights holders, we cannot guarantee that such agreements will continue to be renewed indefinitely.
Business Overview—Licensing Agreements.” We have no control over third-party providers of the content we stream.
The concentration of control of content by our major providers means that even one entity, or a small number of entities working together, may unilaterally affect our access to music and other content.
The music industry has a high level of concentration, which means that one or a small number of entities may, on their own, take actions that adversely affect our business.
For example, with respect to sound recordings, the music licensed to us 14 Table of Contents under our agreements with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Music and Entertainment Rights Licensing Independent Network (“Merlin”), makes up the majority of music consumed on our Service.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, this content accounted for approximately 77% of music streams.
Our business may be adversely affected if our access to music is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more of these rights holders or if they choose not to license to us for any other reason.
As a result, our ability to continue to license rights to sound recordings is subject to convincing a broad range of stakeholders of the value and quality of our Service.
Many of our license agreements are complex and impose numerous obligations on us, including obligations to, among other things: • meet certain user and other targets in order to secure certain licenses and royalty rates; • calculate and make payments based on complex royalty structures, which requires tracking usage of content on our Service that may have inaccurate or incomplete metadata necessary for such calculation; • provide periodic reports on the exploitation of the content; • represent that we will obtain all necessary publishing licenses and consents and pay all associated fees, royalties, and other amounts due for the licensing of musical compositions; • provide advertising inventory at discounted rates or on other favorable terms; • comply with certain service offering restrictions; • comply with certain marketing and advertising restrictions; and comply with certain security and technical specifications.
Under our license agreements and relevant statutes, we must pay all required royalties to record labels, music publishers, and other copyright owners in order to stream content.
The determination of the amount and timing of such payments is complex and subject to a number of variables, including the type of content streamed, the country in which it is streamed, the service tier such content is streamed on, the amount of revenue generated by the streaming of the content, the identity of the 15 Table of Contents license holder to whom royalties are owed, the current size of our user base, our current ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, the applicability of any most favored nations provisions, and any applicable advertising fees and discounts, among other variables.
See “—If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.” If we fail to implement and maintain effective controls relating to rights holder liabilities, we may underpay/under-accrue or overpay/over-accrue the royalty amounts payable to record labels, music publishers, and other copyright owners.
As of December 31, 2021, we have estimated future financial commitments of €3.3 billion under license agreements for sound recordings and musical compositions (both for mechanical rights and public performance rights) as well as license agreements for podcasts.
Such financial commitments related to our content acquisition costs are not always tied to our revenue and/or user growth forecasts (e.g., number of users, active users, Premium Subscribers) or the number of sound recordings and musical compositions or podcasts used on our Service.
Accordingly, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability and operating leverage on our Service in part depends on our ability to increase our revenue through increased sales of Premium Service and advertising sales on terms that maintain an adequate gross margin.
The duration of our license agreements for sound recordings and musical compositions that contain minimum guarantees is frequently between one and three years, but our Premium Subscribers may cancel their subscriptions at any time.
To the extent our Premium Service revenue growth or advertising sales do not meet our expectations, our business, operating results, and financial condition could also be adversely affected as a result of such financial commitments.
We rely on estimates of the market share of streaming content owned by each content provider, as well as our own user growth and forecasted advertising revenue, to forecast whether such financial commitments could be recouped against our actual content acquisition costs incurred over the duration of the license agreement.
Difficulties in obtaining accurate and comprehensive information necessary to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings on our Service and the ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations under our licenses, affect the size of our catalog, impact our ability to control content acquisition costs, and lead to potential copyright infringement claims.
See “—We depend upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.” These challenges, and others concerning the licensing of musical compositions embodied in sound recordings on our Service, may subject us to significant liability for copyright infringement, breach of contract, or other claims.
Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Legal or Arbitration Proceedings.” Our ability to provide our Service is dependent upon our ability to license intellectual property rights to audio content, including sound recordings, any musical compositions embodied therein, and podcasts, as well as visual and related content, such as music videos, clips, album cover art, artist images, and any other media assets that artists and/or labels can add or provide with their tracks.
See “—Difficulties in obtaining accurate and comprehensive information necessary to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings on our Service and the ownership thereof may impact our ability to perform our obligations under our licenses, affect the size of our catalog, impact our ability to control content acquisition costs, and lead to potential copyright infringement claims.” While we may often be able to seek indemnities from our licensors with respect to infringement claims that may relate to the content they provide to us, such indemnities may not be sufficient to cover the associated liability if the licensor at issue does not have adequate financial resources.
Moreover, we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement from content that artists, podcasters, and other creators or users make available on our Service.
See “—We may be subject to disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our Service.” In addition, music, internet, technology, and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights.
We currently own the www.spotify.com internet domain name and various other related domain names.
Risks Related to Our Operations Streaming depends on effectively working with operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards we do not control.
We rely on a variety of operating systems, online platforms, hardware, and networks to reach our users.
Online platforms also may unilaterally impose certain requirements that negatively affect our ability to convert users to the Premium Service, such as conditions that limit our freedom to communicate promotions and offers to our users.
Moreover, our Service requires high-bandwidth data capabilities.
If the costs of data usage increase or access to data networks is limited, our business may be seriously harmed.
Additionally, to deliver high-quality audio, video, and other content over networks, our Service must work well with a range of technologies, systems, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control.
In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity, or use of the internet, including laws governing internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our Service and increase our cost of doing 19 Table of Contents business.
If the FCC does not reinstate open internet rules beyond disclosure requirements and state laws fail to provide comparable protections, or if the EU modifies its own open internet rules, broadband service providers may be able to limit our users’ ability to access Spotify or make Spotify a less attractive alternative to our competitors’ applications, and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be seriously harmed.
See “Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—Our royalty payment scheme is complex, and it is difficult to estimate the amount payable under our license agreements or relevant statutes.” We could also face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty.
Interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our own systems or from third parties could harm our business.
We have experienced, and may in the future experience, periodic service interruptions and delays involving our own systems and those of third parties that we work with.
We have designed our software and computer systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by GCP, currently rely on GCP for the vast majority of our primary data storage (including personal data of users and audio data licensed from rights holders) and computing, and any transition of our GCP operations to another cloud provider would incur significant time and expense.
As we collect and utilize personal data about our users as they interact with our products and services, we are subject to new and existing laws and regulations that govern our use of user data.
New laws, amendments to, or reinterpretations of existing laws, rules of self-regulatory bodies, industry standards, and contractual obligations, as well as changes in our users’ expectations and demands regarding privacy and data security, may require that we expend considerable resources to meet these requirements and may limit our ability to collect, use, and disclose, and to leverage and derive economic value from user data.
Restrictions on our ability to collect, access and harness user data, or to use or disclose user data, may require us to expend significant resources to adapt to these changes, and would in turn limit our ability to stream personalized content to our users and offer advertising and promotional opportunities to users on the Service.
Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing the “Spotify” brand is critical to expanding our base of users and advertisers, as well as continuing to attract creators, and will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products and services, which we may not do successfully.
We may introduce new products, services, features, content, or terms of service that our users, creators, advertisers, or partners do not like, which may negatively affect our brand.
Additionally, the actions of our developers, advertisers, and content partners may affect our brand if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications or websites integrated with Spotify or that make use of Spotify content or brand features.
If we are unable to maintain the growth of our Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers, we may be required to expend greater resources than we currently spend on advertising, marketing, and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand, which would adversely affect our operating results and may not be effective.
An increase in those fees would require us to either increase the prices we charge for our Premium Service, which could cause us to lose Premium Subscribers and subscription revenue, or suffer an increase in our costs without a corresponding increase in the price we charge for our Premium Service, either of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our Premium Subscribers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Certain payment card associations have proposed additional requirements for trial offers for automatic renewal subscription services, which may hinder our ability to attract or retain Premium Subscribers.
Qualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the digital media industry, and we may incur significant costs to attract them.
Our financial performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of advertising spending.
Economic conditions may adversely impact levels of consumer spending, which could adversely impact the number of users who purchase our Premium Service on our website and mobile application.
To the extent that overall economic conditions reduce spending on discretionary activities, our ability to retain current and obtain new Premium Subscribers could be hindered, which could reduce our subscription revenue and negatively impact our business.
We regularly review key metrics related to the operation of our business, including, but not limited to, our monthly active users (“MAUs”), Ad-Supported MAUs, Premium average revenue per user (“ARPU”), and Premium Subscribers, to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions.
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our Service is used across large populations globally.
For example, we believe that while there are individuals who have multiple Spotify accounts, which we treat as multiple users for purposes of calculating our active users, there are also Spotify accounts that are used by more than one person.
In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology, including improvements in our ability to identify and/or address previously undetected undesirable user behaviors.
We have in the past been, and continue to be, impacted by attempts by third parties to artificially manipulate stream counts.
Such attempts may, for example, be designed to generate revenue for content providers and/or rights holders or to influence placement of content on Spotify-created playlists or industry charts.
For example, we have detected instances of botnet operators creating non-bona fide user accounts or hackers using passwords compromised as a result of a data breach on a non-Spotify service to access legitimate user accounts and streaming specific content repeatedly, thereby generating royalties each time the content is streamed or increasing its visibility on our or third- 26 Table of Contents party charts.
We use a combination of algorithms and manual review by employees to detect artificial streams and aim to remove non-bona fide user accounts created for the above purposes and filter them out from our metrics on an ongoing basis, as well as to require users to reset passwords that we suspect have been compromised.
However, we may not be successful in detecting, removing, and addressing all artificial streams and any related user accounts.
If we fail to successfully detect, remove, and address artificial streams and associated user accounts, it may result in the manipulation of our data, including the key performance indicators, which underlie, among other things, our contractual obligations with rights holders and advertisers (which could expose us to the risk of litigation), as well as harm our relationships with rights holders and advertisers.
In addition, once we detect and mitigate artificial streams and associated user accounts, this may result in the removal of certain user accounts and/or a reduction in account activity, which may affect key performance indicators and undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators.
For example, we have detected instances of third parties seeking to provide mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the Ad-Supported Service on tablets and desktop computers.
Additionally, Ad-Supported Users using unauthorized versions of our application may be less likely to convert to Premium Subscribers.
34 Table of Contents On February 14, 2019, we acquired Anchor FM Inc. (“Anchor”), a software company that enables users to create and distribute their own podcasts, for a total purchase consideration of €136 million.
The acquisition allows us to leverage Anchor’s creator-focused platform to accelerate our path to becoming the world’s leading audio platform.
On February 15, 2019, we acquired Gimlet Media Inc. (“Gimlet”), an independent producer of podcast content, for a total purchase consideration of €172 million.
The acquisition allows us to leverage Gimlet’s in-depth knowledge of original content production and podcast monetization.
The acquisition allows us to expand our content offering, audience reach, and podcast monetization.
On December 8, 2020, we acquired Megaphone LLC (“Megaphone”), a podcast technology company, for a total purchase consideration of €195 million.
The acquisition allows us to expand and scale our podcast monetization and product offering for advertisers.
The acquisition allows us to accelerate our entry into the live audio space.
On June 17, 2021, we acquired Podz, Inc. (“Podz”), a technology company focused on the podcast discovery experience, for a total purchase consideration of €45 million.
The acquisition allows us to complement and accelerate our focused efforts to drive podcast discovery, deliver listeners the right content at the right time, and accelerate growth of the podcast category worldwide.
We are the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service with a community of 406 million MAUs, including 180 million Premium Subscribers, across 184 countries and territories as of December 31, 2021.
Music Industry Growth Continues to be Led by Streaming Following more than 10 years of decline as the industry transitioned from physical product sales to streaming access models, the global recorded music business hit its digital inflection point in 2015 and has grown ever since.
Global recorded music industry revenues grew 7% to $22 billion in 2020, following on growth of 8% in 2019, 10% in 2018, 8% in 2017, 9% in 2016, and 4% in 2015.
Industry-wide streaming revenues grew nearly 20% in 2020, accounting for over 62% of global recorded music industry revenues.
As the world's most popular global audio streaming subscription service, we are a key driver of global recorded music revenue growth.
Through December 31, 2021, we have paid more than €26 billion in royalties to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders since our launch.
In 2021, our expenses for rights holders grew by 19% compared to the prior year, making us one of the largest engines for revenue growth to artists and labels in the music industry.
Spotify is the World's Most Popular Audio Streaming Subscription Service 35 Table of Contents Spotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music and podcasts.
Today, millions of people around the world have access to over 82 million tracks, including more than 3.6 million podcast titles, through Spotify whenever and wherever they want.
We have transformed the music industry by allowing users to move from a “transaction-based” experience of buying and owning music to an “access- based” model, which allows users to stream music on demand.
In contrast, traditional radio relies on a linear distribution model in which stations and channels are programmed to deliver a limited song selection with little freedom of choice.
We are actively investing in podcasts and other forms of alternative and spoken word content to complement the music library available through our platform.
To the extent such content is made exclusive to our platform through direct ownership or licensing arrangements, we believe these investments help differentiate our Service, attract incremental users, and enhance engagement.
Every day, fans from around the world trust our brand to guide them to music, podcasts, and entertainment that they would never have discovered on their own.
If discovery drives delight, and delight drives engagement, and engagement drives discovery, we believe Spotify wins and so do our users.
Our brand reflects culture—and occasionally creates it—by turning vast and intriguing listening data into compelling stories that remind people of the role music, podcasts, and other audio content play in their lives and encourage new fans to join Spotify each week.
We have been instrumental in reshaping the way in which our users enjoy, discover, and share audio content, and with our marketplace strategy, we are empowering creators by offering unique insights and developing new tools designed to give creators more power and control and by unlocking new monetization opportunities for creators.
Spotify is uniquely positioned to offer creators and fans access to one another, and to provide creators with analytics and tools that help them to better understand their fans, to support themselves, and to be able to live off of their creative work.
Our Business Model We offer both Premium and Ad-Supported Services.
Our Premium and Ad-Supported Services live independently, but thrive together.
Our Ad-Supported Service serves as a funnel, driving a significant portion of our total gross added Premium Subscribers.
We believe our Ad-Supported Service is a strong and viable stand-alone product with considerable long-term opportunity for growth in Ad-Supported Users and revenue.
Despite the worldwide disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and shifted listening patterns, our Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers continued to spend significant time engaging with our Service.
Combined, our audience streamed 110 billion hours of content for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 20% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition to accessing our catalog on computers, tablets, and mobile devices, users can 36 Table of Contents connect through speakers, receivers, televisions, cars, game consoles, and smart devices.
We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of the Premium Service.
The Premium Service is sold directly to end users and through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end customers.
Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement.
We also bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.
We offer a variety of subscription pricing plans for our Premium Service, including our Standard plan, Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan, among others, to appeal to users with different lifestyles and across various demographics and age groups.
Our pricing varies by plan and is adapted to each local market to align with consumer purchasing power, general cost levels, and willingness to pay for an audio service.
In addition, as we have entered into new markets where recurring subscription services are less common, we have expanded our subscription products to include prepaid options and durations other than monthly (both longer and shorter durations), as well as expanded both online and offline payment options.
Revenue from our Premium segment is a function of the number of Premium Subscribers who subscribe to our Premium Service.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 180 million and 155 million Premium Subscribers, respectively.
New Premium Subscribers are primarily sourced from the conversion of our Ad-Supported Users.
Through both our online platform and external marketing efforts, we engage our Ad-Supported Users by highlighting key features that encourage conversion to our subscription offerings.
Additionally, new subscriber growth also is driven by the success of converting users from our trial programs to full-time Premium Subscribers.
Ad-Supported Service Our Ad-Supported Service has no subscription fees and generally provides Ad-Supported Users with limited on-demand online access to our catalog of music and unlimited online access to our catalog of podcasts on their computers, tablets, and compatible mobile devices.
It serves as both a Premium Subscriber acquisition channel and a robust option for users who are unable or unwilling to pay a monthly subscription fee but still want to enjoy access to a wide variety of high-quality audio and video content.
We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising impressions across our music and podcast content.
Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal self- serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis.
Our advertising strategy centers on the belief that advertising products that are based in music and podcasts and are relevant to Ad-Supported Users and podcast listeners can enhance user experiences and provide even greater returns for advertisers.
We have historically introduced, and continue to introduce, new advertising products across both music and podcast content.
In February 2021, we announced the Spotify Audience Network (“SPAN”), an audio advertising marketplace which connects advertisers to listeners across our owned and exclusive podcasts, podcasts from enterprise publishers via Megaphone, and podcasts from emerging creators via Anchor.
Through SPAN, we provide hosting and ad-insertion capabilities for audio publishers that allow us to sell targeted advertising to brand partners to reach listeners both on and off our platform.
37 Table of Contents Revenue for our Ad-Supported segment is affected primarily by, but not limited to, the number of our Ad-Supported Users, the total hours of content consumed by Ad-Supported MAUs, and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to our Ad-Supported Users and podcast listeners and enhance returns for our advertising partners.
Below is a summary of certain provisions of our license agreements relating to sound recordings and the musical compositions embodied therein (i.e., the musical notes and the lyrics), as well as podcasts and other non-music content.
They also often include marketing commitments, advertising inventory, financial and data reporting obligations, and numerous prescriptions about the manner in which the Spotify service is operated.
Rights to sound recordings granted pursuant to these agreements accounted for over 77% of music streams for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Risk Factors—Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—Financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements may limit our operating flexibility and may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.” We also have direct license agreements with independent labels, as well as companies known as “aggregators” (for example, Believe Digital, CDBaby, Distrokid, and TuneCore).
We also offer marketplace programs, some of which may result in a discounted recording royalty rate.
These agreements have music usage reporting obligations on Spotify and typically have one to four-year terms, and are limited to the territory of the United States and its territories and possessions.
Podcast License Agreements with Podcasters and Podcast Networks With respect to podcasts and other non-music content for which we obtain distribution rights directly from rights holders, we either negotiate licenses directly with individuals or entities or obtain rights through our owned and operated platforms, such as Anchor, Soundtrap for Storytellers, and Spotify for Podcasters, that enable creators to post content directly to our Service after agreeing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions.
Risk Factors—Risks Related to Securing the Rights to the Content We Stream—We depend upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.” Intellectual Property The success of our business depends on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including the intellectual property rights underlying our Service.

The acquisition allows us to complement and accelerate our focused efforts to drive podcast discovery, deliver listeners the right content at the right time, and accelerate growth of the podcast category worldwide.
How We Generate Revenue We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments—Premium and Ad-Supported.
In addition to accessing our catalog on computers, tablets, and mobile devices, users can connect through speakers, receivers, televisions, cars, game consoles, and smart devices.
We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of the Premium Service.
The Premium Service is sold directly to end users and through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end customers.
Premium partner subscription 43 Table of Contents revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement.
We also bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.
We offer a variety of subscription pricing plans for our Premium Service, including our Standard plan, Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan, among others, to appeal to users with different lifestyles and across various demographics and age groups.
Our pricing varies by plan and is adapted to each local market to align with consumer purchasing power, general cost levels, and willingness to pay for an audio service.
In addition, as we have entered into new markets where recurring subscription services are less common, we have expanded our subscription products to include prepaid options and durations other than monthly (both longer and shorter durations), as well as expanded both online and offline payment options.
Revenue from our Premium segment is a function of the number of Premium Subscribers who subscribe to our Premium Service.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 180 million and 155 million Premium Subscribers, respectively.
New Premium Subscribers are primarily sourced from the conversion of our Ad-Supported Users.
Through both our online platform and external marketing efforts, we engage our Ad-Supported Users by highlighting key features that encourage conversion to our subscription offerings.
Additionally, new subscriber growth also is driven by the success of converting users from our trial programs to full-time Premium Subscribers.
The rate of net growth in Premium Subscribers also is affected by our ability to retain our existing Premium Subscribers and the mix of subscription pricing plans.
We have increased retention over time, as new features and functionality have led to increased user engagement and satisfaction.
We have found that Premium Subscribers who access our Service through multiple devices have higher engagement and lower churn, which increases their expected lifetime value to Spotify.
Ad-Supported Our Ad-Supported Service has no subscription fees and generally provides Ad-Supported Users with limited on-demand online access to our catalog of music and unlimited online access to our catalog of podcasts on their computers, tablets, and compatible mobile devices.
It serves as both a Premium Subscriber acquisition channel and a robust option for users who are unable or unwilling to pay a monthly subscription fee but still want to enjoy access to a wide variety of high-quality audio content We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising impressions across our music and podcast content.
Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal self- serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis.
Revenue from our Ad-Supported segment is dependent primarily on the number and hours of engagement of our Ad-Supported Users and podcast listeners and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to those users and enhance returns for our advertising partners.
Our advertising strategy centers on the belief that advertising products that are based in music and podcasts and are relevant to Ad-Supported Users and podcast listeners can enhance user experiences and provide even greater returns for 44 Table of Contents advertisers.
We have historically introduced, and continue to introduce, new advertising products across both music and podcast content.
In February 2021, we announced the Spotify Audience Network (“SPAN”), an audio advertising marketplace which connects advertisers to listeners across our owned and exclusive podcasts, podcasts from enterprise publishers via Megaphone, and podcasts from emerging creators via Anchor.
Through SPAN, we provide hosting and ad-insertion capabilities for audio publishers that allow us to sell targeted advertising to brand partners to reach listeners both on and off our platform.
Revenue from our Ad-Supported segment will also be impacted by the demographic profile of our Ad-Supported Users and podcast listeners and our ability to enable advertisers to reach their target audience with relevant advertising in the geographic markets in which we operate.
A large percentage of our Ad- Supported Users are between 18 and 34 years old.
By offering advertisers increased “self-serve options,” we continue to improve the efficiency and scalability of our advertising platform.
Monetizing our Ad-Supported User base has historically been, and is expected to remain, more challenging in our two fastest growing regions, Latin America and the rest of the world, compared to Europe and North America.
Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.
We incur royalty costs, which we pay to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders, for the right to stream music to our users.
Generally, Premium Service royalties are based on the greater of a percentage of revenue and a per user amount.
Royalties for the Ad-Supported Service are typically a percentage of relevant revenue, although certain agreements are based on the greater of a percentage of relevant revenue and an amount for each time a sound recording and musical composition are streamed.
We have negotiated lower per user amounts for our lower priced subscription plans such as Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan users.
The targets can include such measures as the number of Premium Subscribers, the ratio of Ad-Supported Users to Premium Subscribers, and/or the rates of Premium Subscriber churn.
Cost of revenue also includes the amortization of podcast content assets (both produced and licensed).
Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period (if relevant) and begins at the release of each episode.
We make payments to podcast publishers, whose content we monetize through advertising sales, which are also included in cost of revenue.
Cost of revenue also includes credit card and payment processing fees for subscription revenue, customer service, certain employee compensation and benefits, cloud computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs.
We invest heavily in research and development in order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction on our platform, which we believe helps drive organic growth in MAUs, which in turn drives additional growth in, and better retention of, Premium Subscribers, as well as increased advertising opportunities to our users.
Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for the development of products related to our platform and Service, as well as new advertising products and improvements to our mobile application and desktop application and streaming services.
Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, public relations, branding, consulting expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, marketing events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with music record labels, publishers, songwriters, and artists to promote the availability of new releases on our platform, and the costs of providing free trials of our Premium Service.
We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated.
Additionally, though we strive to detect and minimize non-bona fide accounts that may typically be created in an attempt to artificially stream content, they may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement in our reported MAUs.
MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Service, both through geographic expansion and consumer marketing.
MAUs also benefited from continued investment in content and features on our platform, including featured playlists, artist marketing campaigns, podcasts, and original content, to drive increased user engagement and customer satisfaction.
Premium Subscribers We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for Premium Service.
Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan Subscription.
The table below sets forth our Premium Subscribers as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
46 Table of Contents As of December 31, Change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs. 2020 2020 vs. 2019 (in millions, except percentages) Premium Subscribers 180 155 124 25 16 % 30 24 % Premium Subscribers were 180 million as of December 31, 2021.
The Family Plan was a meaningful contributor of total gross added Premium Subscribers, while our free trial offers and global campaigns also accounted for a significant portion of gross added Premium Subscribers.
In addition, there was an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers on our Duo Plan.
Ad-Supported MAUs We define Ad-Supported MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated.
Ad-Supported MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Ad-Supported Service, both through geographic expansion and consumer marketing.
Ad-Supported MAUs also benefited from continued investment in content and features on our platform, including featured playlists, artist marketing campaigns, podcasts, and original content, to drive increased Ad-Supported User engagement and customer satisfaction.
The increase was attributable primarily to a 16% increase in Premium Subscribers.
Ad-Supported revenue For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 12% and 9% of our total revenue, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, Ad-Supported revenue increased by €463 million or 62%.
This increase was due primarily to growth in music impressions sold and growth in CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions), which increased revenue in our direct and programmatic channels by €181 million and €87 million, respectively.
Ad sales from our self-serve platform, podcast ad sales from SPAN, The Ringer, and exclusive licensing of the Joe Rogan Experience also contributed to the increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in Premium cost of revenue was driven primarily by the growth in new Premium Subscribers and publishing licensing rate increases, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs, collectively resulting in higher royalty costs of €898 million.
The increase in Ad-Supported cost of revenue was driven primarily by higher royalty and SPAN revenue sharing arrangement costs of €235 million due to growth in both advertising revenue and streams as well as publishing licensing rate increases, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs.
The increase in Ad-Supported gross margin was due primarily to a decrease in streaming delivery, ad servicing and production cost as a percentage of revenue.
Additionally, podcast revenue growth outpaced podcast costs growth.
These benefits were partially offset by increases in publishing licensing rates.
(4) We are subject to various non-cancelable purchase obligations and service agreements with minimum spend commitments, including a service agreement with Google for the use of Google Cloud Platform and certain podcast commitments.
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” D. Trend Information Our results reflect the effects of our trial programs, both discounted and free trials, in addition to seasonal trends in user behavior and, with respect to our Ad-Supported segment, advertising behavior.
Historically, Premium Subscriber growth accelerates when we run such trial programs.
For our Ad-Supported segment, typically we experience higher advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater advertising demand during the holiday season.
However, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we typically experience a seasonal decline in advertising revenue due to reduced advertiser demand.

Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, internal self- serve, and advertising marketplace platforms to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a cost-per-thousand basis.
Content We incur royalty costs for the right to stream music to our users, paid to record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders.
Calculations are based on either Premium and Ad-Supported revenue earned or user/usage measures or a combination of these.
In particular, in certain jurisdictions rights holders have several years to claim royalties for works streamed each month.
