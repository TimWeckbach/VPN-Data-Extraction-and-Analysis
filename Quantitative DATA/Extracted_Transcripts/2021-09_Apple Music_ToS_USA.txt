INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES This Agreement governs your use of Apple’s Services (“Services” – e.g., and where available, App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcast Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, iTunes), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”).
Content may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party.
To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply).
USING OUR SERVICES PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.
However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for some Content you acquire from Apple Books, Apple Podcasts, or App Store as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service.
In such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.).
Apple will charge your selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes.
You can associate multiple payment methods with your Apple ID, and you agree that Apple may store and charge those payment methods for Transactions.
In accordance with local law, Apple may automatically update your payment information regarding your payment methods if provided such information by the payment networks or your financial institutions.
For more details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/HT201359.
If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.
Terms related to store credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/.
ACCOUNT Using our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID.
An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem.
Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account.
Please contact Apple if you suspect that your account has been compromised.
PRIVACY Your use of our Services is subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is available at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/.

Apple may monitor your use of the Services and Content to ensure that you are following these Usage Rules.
All Services: - You may use the Services and Content only for personal, noncommercial purposes (except as set forth in the App Store Content section below).
- Apple’s delivery of Services or Content does not transfer any commercial or promotional use rights to you, and does not constitute a grant or waiver of any rights of the copyright owners.
- You can use Content from up to five different Apple IDs on each device.
- For any Service, you can have up to 10 devices (but only a maximum of 5 computers) signed in with your Apple ID at one time, though simultaneous streams or downloads of Content may be limited to a lower number of devices as set out below under Apple Music and Apple TV content.
- You may access our Services only using Apple’s software, and may not modify or use modified versions of such software.
Audio and Video Content Sales and Rentals: - You can use Digital Rights Management (DRM)-free Content on a reasonable number of compatible devices that you own or control.
- Content rentals are viewable on a single device at a time, and must be played within 30 days, and completed within 48 hours of the start of play (stopping, pausing or restarting does not extend this period).
- You may burn an audio playlist of purchased music to disc for listening purposes up to seven times; this limitation does not apply to DRM-free Content.
- Purchased Content will generally remain available for you to download, redownload, or otherwise access from Apple.
Though it is unlikely, subsequent to your purchase, Content may be removed from the Services (for instance, because the provider removed it) and become unavailable for further download or access from Apple.
To ensure your ability to continue enjoying Content, we encourage you to download all purchased Content to a device in your possession and to back it up.
App Store Content: - The term “Apps” includes apps and App Clips for any Apple platform and/or operating system, including any in- app purchases, extensions (such as keyboards), stickers, and subscriptions made available in such apps or App Clips.
- Individuals acting on behalf of a commercial enterprise, governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise; or (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise.
Apple Music: - An Individual Apple Music membership allows you to stream on a single device at a time; a Family membership allows you or your Family members to stream on up to six devices at a time.

You may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (“Redownload”) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (“Associated Devices”).
You can see Content types available for Redownload in your Home Country at https://support.apple.com/HT204632.
Content also may be removed from our Services at any time, after which it cannot be downloaded, redownloaded, or otherwise accessed from Apple.
SUBSCRIPTIONS The Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or Services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”).
Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings.
To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit https://support.apple.com/HT202039.
We will notify you if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, seek your consent to continue.
You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.
This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period.
We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.
Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.
If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends.
If you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription offered by Apple as Content provider (an “Apple Paid Subscription”) and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.
Free trials or free offers to Apple Paid Subscriptions, excluding iCloud, cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of Apple One.
If you are in a free trial or free offer for any Apple Paid Subscriptions, and you subscribe to Apple One, your free trial(s) or offer(s) will not be paused even if you have access to such Apple Paid Subscription(s) through your Apple One subscription.
You acknowledge that your free trial or free offer may expire while you are a Paid Subscriber to Apple One, and Apple shall have no obligation to reinstate, reimburse, or otherwise compensate you for any part of such expired free trial or free offer.
When your Paid Subscription to any Service or Content ends, you will lose access to any functionality or Content of that Service that requires a Paid Subscription.
CONTENT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY Terms found in this Agreement that relate to Services, Content types, features or functionality not available in your Home Country are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you.
To see the Content types available to you in your Home Country, go to the Services or visit https://support.apple.com/HT204411.
THIRD-PARTY DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT You may not be able to use all features of the Services when accessing them on a non-Apple-branded device.
By using the Services, you agree that Apple may automatically download and install minor updates to its software on third-party equipment from time to time.
Except to the extent prohibited by law, you hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials you submit within the Services and related marketing, and Apple internal purposes.
Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features.
Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to six members of a Family.
Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing.
Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing.
Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.
E. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION FEATURES The Services may recommend Content to you based on your downloads, purchases and other activities.
F. ADDITIONAL ITUNES STORE TERMS SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS A Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available.
If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.
G. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS) LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”).
An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider.
Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”).
The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App.
You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.
IN-APP PURCHASES Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”).
In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once.
APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law.
App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.
APP BUNDLES Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”).
The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle.
The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.
Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.
You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so.
H. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR CERTAIN CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES Some Content available in Apple Books, App Store, and Apple Podcasts (including Apple Podcast Subscriptions) are acquired by You from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple.
For example, Apple Books Content is acquired from book publishers, not Apple.
In such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider.
However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for the Content you acquire, but such Content is licensed by the Content provider.
ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS iCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or another source (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices.
iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership.
iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content.
This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music.
iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple).
Songs acquired from the iTunes Store do not count against this limit.
Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library.
When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback.
You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content.
iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies.
You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library.
If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library.
When your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library, including iCloud Music Library Content that is uploaded to iCloud Music Library servers.
K. CARRIER MEMBERSHIP Where available, you may be offered to purchase a Service membership from your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”).
If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier is the merchant of record, which means that you acquire the Service license from your carrier, which will bill you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is licensed and provided by Apple.
Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple.
By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.
