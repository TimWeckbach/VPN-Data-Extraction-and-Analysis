Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices and services.
The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5 In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.
The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6 To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.
Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device.
Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8 The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.
In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.
Some third- party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future.
Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.
Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.
The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers.
If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer.

If developers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.
