Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.
We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers Developing new products, services and solutions is complex , requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits.
If we do not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.
Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative Al, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results: Social, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AL including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm liability and additional costs.
We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings.
If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective o inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of Al solutions O cause harm to individuals, customers or society, o result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes Jurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI.
While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of Al, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future Al regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to Al, including affecting our ability to make our Al offerings available without costly changes, delaying or halting development of Al offerings, requiring us to change our Al development practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting uS to additional   compliance requirements, regulatory action,  competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal  liability.
Uncertainty around new and evolving Al uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing Al models, datasets o hardware.
Developing; testing and deploying Al systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs 23 they we keep Table of Contents involved in such systems.
These costs could adversely impact our margins as we continue to make significant investments in Al development, add Al capabilities to our offerings and scale our Al offerings without assurance that our customers and users will adopt them.
Further; as with any new offerings based on new technologies, consumer reception and monetization pathways are uncertain, our strategies may not be successful and our business and financial results could be adversely impacted.
New AI offerings and technologies could modify workforce needs, result in negative publicity about AI and decrease demand for our existing products, services and solutions, all of which could adversely impact our business We participate in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and, if we d not compete effectively, our operating results could suffer: The  markets for our products,  services   and   solutions are rapidly evolving   and  intensely  competitive.
Our numerous competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant sales and research and development resources, broad brand awareness, long operating histories or access to large customer bases to small companies whose specialized focuses may allow them to more easily and effectively deploy technical, marketing and financial resources.
Our competitors may develop or acquire products, services or solutions that are Similar to ours or that achieve greater or faster acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts O marketing campaigns Or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies As a result, current and potential customers may select the products, services or solutions of our competitors Further, our future success depends on our continued ability to effectively appeal to businesses and consumers_ New industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, short product life cycles, customer sensitivity, global market conditions and the frequent of new products or competitors may increase downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and adversely affect our renewal, upsell and cross-sell rates as well as our ability to attract new customers.
Other  companies have, or in the   future may  obtain; proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our Al offerings Further, we expect AI offerings to be highly competitive and rapidly evolving For example, we face increasing competition from companies offering generative Al capabilities, including text-to-image, text-to-video and multi-modal offerings that compete directly with our  creative offerings If we are not able to provide products, services and solutions that  compete effectively, we could experience reduced sales and our business could be adversely affected.
We believe our reputation and brands have been, and we expect them to continue to be, important to our business and financial results Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful.
If we fail to maintain, enhance O protect our brands, o if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts t0 do SO, our users trust in us and purchasing decisions and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.
Our  ability to acquire other businesses or technologies,  make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by adverse economic and political events, including trade tensions, and increased global scrutiny and evolving regulatory expectations relating to acquisitions and strategic investments.
25 they goals prior Any Table of Contents Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Service interruptions Or failures of our or third-party information technology systems may impair the availability 0f our products, services and solutions, which may expose US to liability, damage our reputation and harm our future financial results: Much of our business, including our online store at adobe.com and our cloud solutions, relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed and controlled directly by us or third-party service providers to be available to our customers and users without disruption: We do not have redundancy for all our systems, many of our critical applications (Apps' reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities.
If any critical third-party service provider of hosting O content delivery services is negatively affected or becomes unavailable to us for ay reason; we may not be able to deliver the corresponding products, services or solutions to our customers and users.
Failure of our systems Or those of our third-party service providers could cause large, system-wide failures, disrupt our business operations and those of our  customers,  subject uS to reputational  harm, require costly and time-intensive  notifications,  and cause uS to lose customers, users and future business Occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments.
If a transition   among data centers or to third-party   service   providers  encounters  unexpected  interruptions, unforeseen complexity Or unplanned   disruptions despite precautions   undertaken  during the process, this may impair our delivery of products, services and solutions to customers and result in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results, reputation and our business.
Furthermore, our  ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic 0 customer websites We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real-time due to factors such as significant spikes in customer activity o their websites o failures of our network Or software (or that of a third-party service provider).
If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer and user base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers O those of third parties, service outages Or performance issues could occur, which may impact our customers.
Such a strain 0n our infrastructure capacity may subject US to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments o financial liabilities and result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business If we supply materially inaccurate information O experience significant interruptions in our systems, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers and we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses Security incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our customers" data or other cybersecurity incidents may harm our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business: Our  products,  services   and  solutions   collect,  store, manage  ad otherwise process   third-party   data,  including  our customers data and our own data.
Such products, services and solutions as well as our technologies, systems and networks have been subject to, and may in the future be subject to, cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, fraud, worms, social  engineering, denial-of-service attacks, malicious software programs,  insider  threats  and other  cybersecurity incidents that have in the past, and may in the future, result in the unauthorized access, disclosure, acquisition, use, loss o destruction of sensitive personal or business data belonging to US, our employees and our customers Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by human error from our workforce or that of our third-party service providers, by malicious third parties, acting alone O in groups, or by more sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and state- sponsored organizations.
Further, unauthorized parties may also physical access to our facilities and infiltrate our information systems Or attempt to logical access to our products, services or information systems to access content and data and may result in computer viruses, worms, ransomware or other malware.
Malicious third parties have in the past; and may in the future, fraudulently induce our employees o users of our products, services o solutions to disclose sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing, social engineering Or other tactics, and this risk is heightened in our current hybrid model working environment: Malicious actors may also engage in fraudulent o abusive   activities   through our   products,  services   and  solutions, including  unauthorized use of accounts  through  stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards O other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, Or other activities that 26 bugs, gain gain Table of Contents violate our terms of service.
While we actively combat such fraudulent activities, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, impacts to our revenue from such activities.
Even if such breach is unrelated to our security systems, solutions or  programs; such breach could cause uS reputational  harm and require us to incur  significant   economic and operational consequences to adequately assess and respond to their breach, and to implement additional safeguards designed to protect against future breaches While we maintain insurance to cover operational risks, such as cybersecurity risk and technology outages, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liability described herein: These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products, services and solutions and store and process more data.
Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyberattacks, overly burdensome preventative security measures or failure to fully meet information security control certification requirements could materially and adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation If we are unable to develop, manage and maintain  critical third-party relationships,  such (LS our sales, partner and distribution channels, suppliers and service providers, our revenue and business may be adversely affected.
We rely on a number of third-party distributors and sales partners to distribute our products, services and solutions The successful  management of such  third-party  relationships is a complex, global  process.
We also face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these independent third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations  workplace conditions, corruption and anti- competitive behavior; If our partner and distribution channels are not effective or if we stop or change our partner or distribution channels, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue.
We rely on third-party distribution platforms and are subject to changes in pricing structure, terms of service, privacy practices and other policies at the discretion of the platform provider: adverse changes to the terms with such third-party distribution platforms which we rely o to distribute our products, services and solutions may adversely affect our financial results.
Additionally, our distribution channels may not continue to market o sell our products, services and solutions effectively and may favor products, services and solutions of other companies.
We sell many products, services and solutions through our direct sales force.
Our business could be harmed if our direct sales expansion efforts do not generate the corresponding efficiencies and revenue we anticipated from such investment  In addition, the loss of sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.
We rely on third-party service providers and technologies to deliver our products, services and business operations and to operate  critical business systems, such as cloud-based infrastructure, data   center   facilities, generative Al, encryption and authentication technology, company email and communications with customers.
If such third parties are negatively affected, if we fail to effectively develop, manage and maintain our relationships with such third parties, Or if we are unable to renew our agreements with them o favorable terms or at all, our expenses could significantly increase, and we and our customers may 27 Any key Table of Contents experience service interruptions disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business.
Further, interruptions in our services caused by US Or our third-party service providers may cause us to issue credits o pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty Or other claims against us O to terminate their subscriptions O contracts, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which may adversely affect our financial results Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.
Other third parties, such as our service providers, suppliers and distributors, may be unable to deliver or be delayed in delivering critical services, products or technologies that we rely 0, and our business and reputation may be harmed   Our customers spending rate and demand for our products, services and solutions may also be adversely affected by the above risks If our global sales are reduced, delayed o canceled because of any of the above risks, ur revenue may decline.
These investments are subject to credit; liquidity, market, and interest rate risks as well as economic downturns Or events that affect global or regional financial markets that may cause the value of our investments to decline, requiring impairment  charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition Some 0f our enterprise Offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which may increase our costs and make our sales cycles unpredictable As we continue to target enterprise customers for certain f our offerings, including Adobe Experience Cloud in our Digital Experience business and our Enterprise Term License Agreements in our Digital Media business, we may face increased costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing our sales.
Since the sales cycles for our enterprise offerings are multi-phased and complex, it is often unpredictable when a given sales cycle will close Our revenue from enterprise customers may be affected by longer-than- expected sales, contract negotiation and implementation cycles, extended collection cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements.
Such activity has increased over time with evolving regulatory landscapes and as our products, services and solutions have become more available and used by, more enterprises and consumers.
For example, third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements 0 unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products, services o solutions, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy 29 cycles.
key to, Any key Table of Contents indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
In addition, we have incurred, ad may in the future incur, significant costs in acquiring the necessary third- party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers.
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws and regulatory requirements could impact our business models and expose US to increased liability: We are subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that relate to our various business units ad data processing activities, which may include sensitive, confidential, and personal information These laws, regulations and codes are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations Government officials and regulators, privacy advocates ad class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, including the transferring of personal information across international borders  This scrutiny can result in new and shifting interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting our business.
These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business   drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (for example, AI and machine learning) and may impact demand  for our offerings and force US to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts.
Perception of our practices, products, services or solutions, even if unfounded, as a violation of individual privacy, data protection rights O cybersecurity requirements, subjects us to public criticism, lawsuits, investigations, claims and other proceedings by regulators, industry groups Or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and reputation and expose us to increased liability, fines and other punitive measures including prohibition 0 sales of our products,  services Or   solutions, restrictive judicial  orders and  disgorgement  of data.
Additionally, we collect and   store information o behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us_ Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copyings use or disclosure Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property are valuable assets to us.
Infringement Or misappropriation of such intellectual property could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value.
We protect our intellectual property by relying o federal, state and common law rights in the United States and internationally, as well as & variety of administrative procedures and contractual restrictions.
Despite our efforts, protecting our intellectual property rights and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property are inherently difficult: For instance, we actively combat software piracy, but we continue to lose revenue due to illegal use of our software.
Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect OUr Tevenue and operating margins If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying, use, O other misappropriation, our business could be harmed.
We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in various government sectors, including to obtain various security authorizations and certifications.
Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term: Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers " level of satisfaction; our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, reliability of our offerings, prices of ours and competitors' offerings, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, changes as a result of regulatory or legal requirements, changes in the composition of our customer base and reductions in our customers spending levels or declines in customer activity.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions Or if renew on terms less favorable to US, our revenue may decline.
If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may suffer and vary from those anticipated: We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure Our operating results and performance metrics are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global  scope of our business   Geopolitical and economic  events, including war, trade   disputes,  economic   sanctions   and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty have caused, and may in the future cause, currencies to fluctuate.
A catastrophic event, particularly one that may disrupt our data centers O our critical activities, could prevent us from conducting normal business operations and providing OUr products, services and solutions, which could adversely affect our business.
We also have a Cyber Disclosure Committee, comprised of cross-functional leaders including finance, risk; operations and investor relations and led by the CSO and CCPO_ that  meets to assess certain incidents ad makes determinations regarding materiality.
We own all of our  San Jose, California properties   which we use for research; product development,  sales, marketing and administrative purposes.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.
For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise andlor o-device software licenses and cloud services.
Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may significant judgment: We have concluded that the on-premiselon-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not   distinct from each other   such that   revenue   from each   offering  should be  recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design Or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2024 For our fiscal 2024,, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, driven by our innovative  product roadmap.

These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new and enhanced desktop, web and mobile apps, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud.
Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, collaborate, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type.
Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes subscriptions to Adobe Acrobat Pro and Standard, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan.
Certain Adobe Acrobat products are also offered as perpetual licenses which are immaterial to our business.
As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (DDOM ) and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, which continue to contribute strong product-led growth in the business.
