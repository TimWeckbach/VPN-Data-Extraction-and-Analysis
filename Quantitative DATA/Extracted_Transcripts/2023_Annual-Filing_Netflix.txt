We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members.
Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members.
COMPETITION The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.
We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear TV, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, like social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.
We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.
While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time.
In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.
SEASONALITY 1 Table of Contents Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing.
Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth.
In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.
We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service.
Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute.
REGULATION The media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action.
We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours.
In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix.
Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content.
In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.
We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.
OTHER INFORMATION We maintain a website at www.netflix.com.
We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues.
Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games.
Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members.
Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.
If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue, including revenue per paying membership, and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games.
For example, we recently introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan.
In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members.
Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.
Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video.
The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models.
All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market.
Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings.
Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources.
4 Table of Contents They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing.
New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video.
Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free, and in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth.
We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials.
We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members.
We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.
We are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service.
We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content, including through acquisitions such as Scanline and Animal Logic.
As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments.
As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our new ad-supported subscription plan, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing, technology and other services.
Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers.
If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.
If we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.
5 Table of Contents We believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members.
To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted.
To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations.
From time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business.
We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.
We currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices.
We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers.
In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service.
If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted.
We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and films to other platforms and partners over time.
If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.
Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business.
In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices.
If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.
Our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing.
In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf.
If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention.
As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax.
We began offering an ad-supported subscription plan that generates revenue partially from digital advertising on our service.
We have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect.
To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.
Our ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute.
As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies.
If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase.
Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly.
As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content.
Music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution.
remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories.
Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.
If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.
We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service.
It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products.
We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace.
Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service.
We utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider.
In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations.
We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films and offer mobile games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet.
This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of 10 Table of Contents content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices.
For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”).
To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business.
We rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet.
To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted.
Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.
Most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming.
While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted.
In the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our ad-supported subscription plan, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data.
In connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers.
Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term.
Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content.
To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements.
If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations.
Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations.
Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant.
For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.
Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors.
For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.
Streaming Revenues We derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members.
We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan.
The following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet.
Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.
Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content.
We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity.
Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content.
In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased personnel costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.
27 Table of Contents Content We acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment.
The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.
For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.
Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.
42 Table of Contents NETFLIX, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 231 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.
The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.
For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.
The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.
Marketing Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile 44 Table of Contents operators and internet service providers ("ISPs").
The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members.
However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.
The increase in Other was primarily due to a modification of a content licensing arrangement.
The expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows: As of December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Less than one year $ 10,038,483 $ 10,019,306 Due after one year and through 3 years 9,425,551 9,238,315 Due after 3 years and through 5 years 2,124,307 3,238,977 Due after 5 years 243,606 664,762 Total content obligations $ 21,831,947 $ 23,161,360 Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content.
