First, the MAU and subscription growth we achieved in 2023 not only surpassed our most ambitious forecasts, but also set a record for the most significant user growth in Spotify's history.
Any new funds are being directed towards acquiring and reactivating high-value users who enhance our base with their deeper engagement and loyalty.
At Spotify, we don’t rely on a single growth strategy but rather adjust our focus based on what the business demands.
For instance, two years ago, we really concentrated on user growth.
Next year, our focus may return to top-of-the-funnel user growth but in the near term, monetization remains our top priority.
Q1 marked a strong start to the year, led by accelerating Revenue growth and record-setting profitability as our focus on monetization and efficiency have begun flowing through our financials.
On the subscription front, the business grew in-line with our guidance, adding 3 million net new Subscribers.
In terms of our user growth outlook, as Daniel mentioned, we’ve made some adjustments to further optimize our marketing activity, and expect improving MAU net add levels over the course of the year.
With respect to price increases and subscriber growth in Q2, our data shows that historical price increases have had minimal impacts on growth.
