Bottom line - it’s a really exciting time at Spotify and I am super pleased at how the business is performing.
It’s been a wild ride… Next, let’s turn to the strength of our subscriber growth.
We walked into 2023 thinking we would do just over 20 million in net subscriber adds for the full year, but we are actually on track to deliver 30 million, which is a significant beat from where we thought we’d be.
All of this sustained growth is a testament to the exceptional value Spotify continues to deliver globally.
And this of course nicely segues into our groundbreaking Audiobooks offering for Premium subscribers we announced a few weeks ago.
Not only will our expansion into this category supercharge the growth of the audiobooks format, but it also will drive engagement and reduce churn, which further enhances our value proposition.
In the first two weeks since launch, Premium subs in these two markets are loving the breadth of titles and have already listened to over 28% of the catalog.
Both MAU and Subscriber growth continue to be well above our historical trend and outperformed forecast.
This has us adding about 112 million MAU for all of 2023 (nearly 60% above our 4 year historical trend) and adding 30 million Subscribers for the year (which is 12% above the historical trend).
