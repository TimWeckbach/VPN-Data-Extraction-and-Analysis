Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.
The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6 In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7 Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9 The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.
In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.
The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10 The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share.
When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.
For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store.
These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.
This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services.
Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content.
Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.
The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.
Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.
Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11 The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.
These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14 The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.
