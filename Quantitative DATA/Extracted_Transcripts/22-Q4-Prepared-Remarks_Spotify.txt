Our user and subscriber numbers continued to climb, showing the value of our investments in the platform over the past few years.
We broke all sorts of records and reached several all-time-highs with an increase of over 30% in user engagement.
By the end of the year, we had more than 100 million tracks on our platform, 5 million podcasts and more than 300,000 audiobooks being enjoyed by almost half a billion listeners.
In the last 12 months, we grew our users substantially, enhanced our capabilities, developed a better product and brought more content to creators and users around the world.
We’ve also made tremendous strides in setting Spotify apart from everyone else in our space.
We will continue to work to build the platform of the future and that will take investment in the new opportunities we outlined including podcasting and audiobooks.
And if anything, thanks to our position in users and subs, this should allow us to both increase revenue per user over time, as well as improve our stickiness with consumers even more.
Total Monthly Active Users grew to 489 million in Q4.
Moving to Premium, we finished the quarter with 205 million Subscribers – 3 million ahead of guidance – thanks to broad-based strength across several regions, particularly in Latin America.
Gross Margin of 25.3% was above guidance by 80 bps due primarily to lower podcast content spend along with broad-based favorability in our core music business led by strength in Marketplace.
On the Subscriber front, we expect to add about 2 million subscribers in Q1, bringing Total Subscribers to 207 million.
While we no longer give full year guidance, Full year 2023 user growth should be close to the average of the last few years and we expect strong subscriber growth as well.
