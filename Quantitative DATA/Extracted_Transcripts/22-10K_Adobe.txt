Our future success will depend o our continued ability to enhance ad integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate   emerging  standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments.
For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices and from desktop to the web.
While we offer our products 0n a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than US, our business could be harmed.
In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform Or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions The potential costs and delays incurred as a result could harm our business.
If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers' rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer: Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share.
Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features o services that are similar to ours or that  achieve greater  acceptance, may undertake more  far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section titled "Competition contained in Part I, Item [ of this report.
However, consumers can, with increasing ease, implement technologies to limit the ability to collect and use data to deliver or advertise services Increased use of methods to control the use of these technologies through customers browsers, operating systems, device settings or ad-blocking' software or applications may harm our business.
Our  ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments.
The success 0f some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content: The success of some of our product ad service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends o our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content: An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers We rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing oes.
New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated Or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations If our products or platforms are used to create or disseminate objectionable content, particularly misleading content intended to manipulate public opinion, our brand reputation may be damaged, and our business and financial results may be harmed We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business.
Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Adobe increases our  ability to enter new categories, launch new and innovative products to better serve our customers and expand our customer base.
Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful.
If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created our products or services or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our business and financial results may be adversely affected: In addition, government regulation designed to address DeepFakes could adversely impact our product offerings Social and ethical issues relating to the use 0f new and evolving technologies, such aS Al, in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability: Social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence (AT ) in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues.
We are increasingly building Al into many of our offerings As with many innovations, Al presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business.
The rapid  evolution of AL will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that Al is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact Uncertainty around new and emerging Al applications such as generative AI content creation may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets and machine learning models, 22 using Table of Contents development of new approaches and processes to provide attribution or remuneration to content creators and building systems that enable creatives to have greater control over the use of their work in the development of AI, which may be costly and could impact our margin if we decide to expand generative Al into all our product offerings.
Developing, testing, and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalfs may compromise the confidentialitys integrity or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose US to liability and adversely affect our reputation and business We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, a large volume of which is hosted by third- party service providers.
We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, GS well aS access, collect, process, use, transmit and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose US to liability and harm our business and reputation Much of our business relies o hardware and services that are hosted, managed and controlled directly by Adobe or third-party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com and our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud solutions.
If a transition among data centers o to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity O unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers ad result in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm OUr operating results, reputation and our business It is also possible that hardware O software   failures O errors  in our systems (or those of our  third-party  service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause uS to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with applicable notification requirements.
Hardware, software and operating system applications that we develop Or procure from third parties contained and may contain defects in design Or manufacture, including vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the or impair a customer's ability to operate O use our products.
This may result in litigation and liability or fines, costly and time-intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry O oversight o a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, thereby requiring time and resources to mitigate these impacts  These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services and store and process more data.
These issues affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts o popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so.
We  continuously monitor  and develop our information  technology networks  and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to our data, systems and networks, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business email compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions: These continued enhancements and changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, may increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in the associated security measures such failure O gap could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.
Moreover; delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks; overly burdensome   preventative   security measures Or failure to   fully   meet  independent   security control certification requirements could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Some of our enterprise Offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales unpredictable Sales  cycles for some of our  enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform solutions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs ) in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex, which also makes it difficult to predict when a given sales will close.
The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including: the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services; the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements to making information technology expenditures and the need for our representatives to a significant amount of time assisting with such evaluations; intensifying competition within the industry; the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts; the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments; and customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions.
As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations.
Alternative arrangements for such products and services may not be available to us o commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.
The failure of third parties to provide acceptable products and services or to update their technology may result in a disruption to our business operations and those of our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation: We increasingly utilize third-party distribution platforms, such as Apple'$ Store and Google $ Store, for the distribution of certain of Our product offerings Although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and may offer Or promote products that compete with our product offerings.
Our customers may react negatively to providing information to_ and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are based overseas If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers and associated revenue.
We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these expected increases in costs, causing OUr results to suffer: We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction: As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future  acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
Failure to manage our sales, partner and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss 0f revenue and harm our business: We contract   with a  number  of software  distributors  and other  strategic partners; none of which are individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue in any recent period  Nonetheless, if an agreement with oe of OUr distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact 0 our results of operations Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for Our products and services is a complex   process across the broad range of geographies where we do business  or plan to do business.
Our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control.
Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively.
If our partner and distribution channels are not successful, we may lose sales  opportunities, customers and revenue.
If our distributors   favor  our competitors products or services  for any reason, may fail to market our products Or services effectively, which would cause our results to suffer: If our OEMs through which we distribute products and services decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer: Further; the financial health of our distributors and partners and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success.
Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts of our direct sales do not generate & corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate.
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose uS to increased liability.
As a global company, Adobe is subject to global data protection privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that  apply to ur various business units and data processing activities These laws, regulations and codes may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations.
These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g , artificial intelligence ad machine learning) These requirements, among   others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts perception of our practices, products Or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection rights may subject us to public criticism; class action lawsuits, reputational harm, Or investigations Or claims by regulators, industry groups O other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose us to increased liability.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset.
Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets,  copyrights   and other   intellectual property rights   could result in lost revenues   and ultimately  reduce  their  value_ Preventing unauthorized use Or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult.
We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software.
If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, further harm our business.
We offer our products and services in foreign countries 28 Any using they may Table of Contents and we may seek intellectual property protection from those foreign legal systems  Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those offered in the United States, and the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business.
Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights: We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the  attention of management and personnel.
Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements o unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products o services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, Or uS to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual  property  rights  for use in our products,  in some cases to fulfill contractual   obligations with our customers.
Our offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and service agreements.
Our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and competitors' offerings, the actual Or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers' spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of general economic conditions Or uncertainty in financial markets, including as a result of a global health crisis and geopolitical conflict, which has affected and may continue to affect certain sectors of the economy disproportionately.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if renew on terms less favorable to uS, our revenue may decline.
We generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters.
Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term: Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect Our revenue, including  longer-than-expected sales   and   implementation   cycles, potential   deferral of revenue ad  alternative licensing arrangements If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.
General Risk Factors Catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations We are a highly  automated business   and rely on our  network   infrastructure  and enterprise   applications   internal technology systems ad website for our development; marketing  operations, support, hosted services and sales activities.
In 31 have things: for, to, Our Table of Contents addition, some of our businesses rely o third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability.
A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event,   power loss,  telecommunications   failure,  software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development; lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data.
of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders Or could negatively impact a country Or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country's or region's demand for our products.
Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities   where we conduct our business_ whether  for our offices o for our  vendors, is a priority.
As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to decrease or  cancel purchases of our products and services.
If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending Or marketing spending This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
Among our customers are government   entities,  including the U.S. federal   government,  and our  revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the government's ability to purchase our products and services.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.
For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise andlor o-device software licenses and cloud services.
Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may significant judgment: We have concluded that the on-premiselon-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not   distinct from each other   such that   revenue   from each   offering  should be  recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design Or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   for   information   regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to uS: ACQUISITIONS In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media reportable segment  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021_ we completed the acquisition of Workfront; a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2022 For our fiscal 2022, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, driven by the ongoing shift towards a digital-first  world.
As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.
Digital Media In our Digital  Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our   subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences.
Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions Creative Cloud delivers   value with cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and 37 profit deep; Table of Contents syncing of files across users' devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community- based   features   with our Adobe   Stock   and Behance  services, app creation  capabilities, tools which assist with   enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises.
We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review: We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service.
Overall, our  strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our   revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably: We continue to   implement   strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and   purchase   of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract customers and potential users to experience   and ultimately  subscribe to Creative Cloud Because of the  shift   towards   Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.
We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type.
Document Cloud, which enhances the way manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat; Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan.
Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.
As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (DDOM' and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.
Annualized Recurring Revenue ARR is currently the performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment: ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric ad is not intended to be combined with ay of these items.
We calculate ARR as follows: Annual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services Creative ARR + Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Annual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services Document Cloud ARR Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value Creative ARR Digital Media ARR 1 Document Cloud ARR In March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war_ we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus.
As a result; we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus.
While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine.
Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021.
Total Digital Media ARR grew to S13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021.
38 past people key using Table of Contents Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth: Creative revenue in fiscal 2022 was 810.46 billion, up from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 10% year-over-year growth: Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2022 was $2.38 billion, up from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 21% year-over-year growth: Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $12.84 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $11.52 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 11% year- over-year growth driven by strong net new user growth: Digital Experience We are a market leader   in the   fast-growing   category  addressed by our Digital   Experience segment; The Adobe Experience   Cloud   applications,  services and  platform  are   designed to   manage customer  journeys, enable   personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry.

Digital Experience revenue was $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021 which represents 14% year-over-year growth.
Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.88 billion in fiscal 2022 from $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 15% year-over-year growth: Macroeconomic Conditions As a corporation  with an extensive   global  footprint; we are   subject to risks and exposures from  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including  but not limited to, the Russia- Ukraine war; COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation: We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances o our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape.
While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our  subscription-based business model; the broader implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall  financial  position; particularly in the long term; remain uncertain.
See the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item IA of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business: 39 By loop: Table of Contents Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2022 Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $13.97 billion as of December 2 2022 increased by $1.82 billion, or 15%, from $12.15 billion as of December 3, 2021.
The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, partially offset by an $87 million ARR reduction taken in March 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war: Creative revenue of $10.46 billion increased by $913 million, or 10%, during fiscal 2022, from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021.
Document Cloud revenue of $2.38 billion increased by $409 million; or 21%, during fiscal 2022, from S1.97 billion in fiscal 2021.

Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition Our  revenue is derived  from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support.
Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers Revenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products o services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be 58 for, Year prior Table of Contents ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) capable of being distinct ad accounted for as separate performance obligations, Or in the case of offerings such as cloud- enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Subscription, Product and Services Offerings We enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual  software licenses, associated software maintenance ad support plans, consulting services, training and technical support:   Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights, Or options to either renew monthly o-premise term-based licenses o use committed funds to purchase other Adobe products Or services.
Fully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without taking possession of the software.
Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis Or based on consumption O usage.
When cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud- enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided The   subscription   support plans related to those customer  arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent stand-ready performance obligations Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably over their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.
Licenses for o-premise software may be purchased o a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time Of based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements.
Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as product revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue from on-premise term license or term licensing arrangements with unilateral cancellation rights Or monthly renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.
Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a in time and our advertising offerings.
These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and- materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts  Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed .
Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the "as-invoiced" practical expedient: Judgments Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.
For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise andlor o-device software licenses and cloud services.
Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other; and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, O not distinct from 59 price point point Table of Contents ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment: We have concluded that the on-premiselon-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings   are not  distinct  from  each other  such that  revenue  from  each  offering  should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided  In reaching this conclusion, considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design  or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams.
When revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer; we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues o a gross basis, Or an agent, and report revenues o a net basis.
This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors Although our  subscription contracts   are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term and consumers have a period of time to terminate certain agreements without penalty.
We do not estimate   variable consideration for our sales and usage-based license royalty agreements, consistent with the associated exception for sales and usage-based royalties for the license of intellectual property under the revenue recognition standard  Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings A credit review is completed for Our new distributors, dealers and OEMs.
In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit-worthiness of the agency' $ customers in addition to the agency itself: If we license our software Or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customer's ability and intention to pay is not probable, the arrangement is not considered to be a revenue contract;  Accordingly, we will not recognize any consideration received as revenue until termination or substantive completion of the services.

Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated to the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date.
Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations Deferred revenue   primarily consists of   billings or   payments   received in advance   of revenue recognition from subscription   services, including  non-cancellable  and non-refundable   committed funds and  refindable   customer  deposits.
Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing; size and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component  The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing Our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers.

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized  which includes   deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as  revenue in future periods Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several   factors, including the timing of renewals and average contract term: We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint Remaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022.
