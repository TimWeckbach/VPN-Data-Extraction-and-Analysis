PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.
They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.
We continue to transform our business to lead in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.
We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers.
Our unique role as a platform and tools provider allows us to connect the dots, bring together an ecosystem of partners, and enable organizations of all sizes to build the digital capability required to address these challenges.
In this next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge.
What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential.
We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services.
Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; and video games.
We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.
• Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.
Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes At Microsoft, we’re providing technology and resources to help our customers navigate a remote environment.
Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office, Dynamics, and LinkedIn.
Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection.
Microsoft Teams is enabling rapid digital transformation by giving people a single tool to chat, call, meet, and collaborate.
Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise.
These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and management.
Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications.
This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers.
Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform In the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees, optimize their operations, engage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services.
Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services.
Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.
Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.
As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength.
Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.
With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge.
We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices.
The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads which we believe will shape the next era of computing.
4 PART I Item 1 The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage.
Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI.
Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways.
In support of this, we are bringing Office, Windows, and devices together for an enhanced and more cohesive customer experience.
Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising.
Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the “intelligent edge.” We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem.
To expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we pursue the expansive opportunity in the gaming industry.
We are broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed across PC, console, and mobile.
Xbox Game Pass, with over 10 million members from 41 countries, is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles.
Project xCloud is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and will give fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.
Our Future Opportunity In a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations as software and cloud computing play a huge role across every industry and around the world.
We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management.
We are investing significant resources in: • Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.
• Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.
• Using Windows to fuel our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and to develop new categories of devices – both our own and third-party – on the intelligent edge.
We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.
To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021.
These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis.
We’re empowering our customers and partners with new technology to help them drive efficiencies, transform their businesses, and create their own solutions for sustainability.
We set an ambitious goal to reduce and ultimately remove Microsoft’s carbon footprint.
By 2030 Microsoft will be carbon negative, and by 2050 Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.
We also launched a new initiative to use Microsoft technology to help our suppliers and customers around the world reduce their own carbon footprint.
We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment.
Our cloud and AI services help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products.
6 PART I Item 1 Investing in Digital Skills With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is making efforts to help ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly vital to many of the world’s jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses, including those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities.
This is combined with $20 million we are investing in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION Our Internet address is www.microsoft.com.
• Announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies.
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.
Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions.
A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth.
• A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces.
They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer.
We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services.
• We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs.
We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength.
• Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases.
The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions.
Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms.
Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.
Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.
• Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license- based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue.
We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products.
Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.
• Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.
Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.
• Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services.
Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.
A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices.
Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in- class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”).
At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers.
Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use.
We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.
Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere.
Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services.
Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: • Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.
• Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other endpoints.
• Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.
• Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.
• Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox Live, LinkedIn, and other products and services.
We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens.
If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue.
We may not get engagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities.
Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.
21 PART I Item 1A Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.
These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks.
We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies.
Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services.
Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers.
Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data.
Adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes as passwords.
User activity may also result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services.
We are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products.
To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.
If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services.
Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services.
As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users.
Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on- premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.
Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities.
Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.
LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures.
Advertising, professional, and social platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, MSN, and Xbox Live, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate.
23 PART I Item 1A Digital safety and service misuse Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law.
Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue.
We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives.
We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.
Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.
We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters.
These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Office 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox Live, and Outlook.com.
We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users.
It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve.
Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.
Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software.
24 PART I Item 1A Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems.
We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers.
Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.
It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.
These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices.
The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs.
The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.
Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms.
Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines, or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them.
• Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.
Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content.
This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations.
Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.
We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal.
There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible.
If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 27 PART I Item 1A Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.
The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries.
Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets.
The Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency.
Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data.
Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: • The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.
• Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.
Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs.
If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.
Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network.
29 PART I Item 1A Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased.
Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.
To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021.
These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis.
Any of these may adversely impact our ability to: • Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services.
• Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through datacenter load balancing.
• Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions.
We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business.
Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.
OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

35 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive.
Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses.
The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.
Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
In the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments, cloud usage and demand increased as customers shifted to work and learn from home.
In the More Personal Computing segment, Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefited from increased demand to support remote work-, play-, and learn-from-home scenarios, while Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend.
These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis.

48 PART II Item 7 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business.
Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff.
We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings.
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time.
Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends.
Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services.
Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer.
Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.
Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer.
In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.
Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”).
SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently.
On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA.
Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.
Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis.
Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period.
Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources.
When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.
When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time.
Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.

Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: • Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.
• Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).
• We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.
