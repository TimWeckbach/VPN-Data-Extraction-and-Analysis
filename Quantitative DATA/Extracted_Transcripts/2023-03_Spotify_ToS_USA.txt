Introduction Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("Content").
By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms.
If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid Subscriptions").
We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services.
Trials From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("Trial").
By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.
Third-party applications, devices and open source software The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices").
Service limitations and modifications We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience.
However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you.
For example: The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.
We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional offerings).
Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.
Your rights to use the Spotify Service Access to the Spotify Service Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "Access").
This Access shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by you or Spotify.
You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.
Spotify's proprietary rights The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.
Payments and cancellation Billing You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by: paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or prepayment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("Prepaid Period").
If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms.
If you purchase Audiobook Content outside of your Paid Subscription, your purchase will be governed by the Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions.
Price and tax changes Spotify may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Prepaid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance.
Renewal and cancellation With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Prepaid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period.
The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service.
If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated with your Code, or when there is an insufficient prepaid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.
User guidelines We've established guidelines for using the Spotify Service, to make sure the Spotify Service stays enjoyable for everyone ("Spotify User Guidelines").
A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.
Content and Intellectual Property Rights User Content The content you post on the Spotify Service Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Spotify Service ("User Content").
For the avoidance of doubt, User Content includes all information, materials and other content that is added, created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, or posted to the Spotify Service (including to the Spotify Support Community) by users.
In posting or sharing User Content or other information on the Spotify Service, please keep in mind that content and other information will be publicly accessible, and may be used and re- shared by others on the Spotify Service and across the web, so please use caution in posting or sharing on the Spotify Service, and be mindful of your account settings.

Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason.
Licenses that you grant to us User Content You retain ownership of your User Content when you post it to the Spotify Service.
However, in order for us to make your User Content available on the Spotify Service, we do need a limited license from you to that User Content.
Accordingly, you hereby grant to Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, make available, perform and display, translate, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, and otherwise use any such User Content through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created, in connection with the Spotify Service.

If you believe that any Content infringes your copyright rights, please see the Spotify Copyright Policy.
