Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results: Social and ethical issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs.
If our AI development; deployment, content labeling O governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions O cause harm to individuals, customers O society, O result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.
Around the world, Al regulation is in the nascent stages of development  The evolving AI regulatory environment may increase our research and development costs, increase our liability related to the use of Al by our customers O users that are beyond our control and result in inconsistencies in evolving legal  frameworks across jurisdictions While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of Al in our offerings, there can be no guarantee that future Al regulations will not adversely impact uS or conflict with our approach to AL including affecting our ability to make our AI offerings available   without  costly   changes,  requiring uS to change our AI  development   practices,  monetization   strategies   and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action , competitive harm or legal 22 Age they rapid rapid Table of Contents liability.
Uncertainty around new and evolving Al use, including generative AI, may require additional investment to develop responsible use frameworks, develop or license proprietary datasets ad machine learning models and develop new approaches and processes to attribute O compensate content creators, which could be costly: Developing, testing and deploying Al systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems  These costs could adversely impact our margins as we continue to add Al capabilities to our offerings and scale our AI offerings without assurance that our customers and users will adopt them.
Further, as with any new offerings based on new technologies consumer reception  and monetization pathways are uncertain, Our strategies may not be successful and our business and financial results could be adversely impacted.
New AI offerings and technologies could disrupt workforce needs, result in negative publicity about Al and have the potential to affect demand for our existing products, services and solutions, all of which could adversely impact our business We may not realize the anticipated benefits 0f investments or acquisitions, and may disrupt our business and divert management'$ attention.
23 they goals prior key Table of Contents Our  ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by adverse economic and political events, including trade tensions, and increased global scrutiny of acquisitions and strategic investments A number of countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted more stringent restrictions O guidelines for such transactions Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions Or government actions could negatively impact our business ad financial results.
We participate in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could suffer: The  markets for our products,  services and   solutions are rapidly  evolving and intensely  competitive.
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant sales and research and development resources, broad brand awareness, operating histories o access to large customer bases to small, specialized companies whose narrow focuses may allow them to be more effective in deploying technical, marketing and financial resources.
Our competitors may develop products, services or solutions that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, Or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies As a result; current and potential customers may select the products, services or solutions of our competitors Further, our future success depends o our continued ability to effectively appeal to businesses and consumers.
New industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to short product life cycles, customer price  sensitivity, global  market  conditions ad the frequent entry of new products Or competitors  may create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and adversely affect our renewal, upsell and cross-sell rates as well as our ability to attract new customers  In addition, we expect to face more competition as Al continues to be integrated into the markets in which we compete.
Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate Al into their offerings more successfully than we do and achieve greater and faster adoption, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business and financial results  Further, we expect the markets for standalone Al offerings to be highly competitive and rapidly evolving: For example, we face increasing competition from companies offering text-to-image generative Al technology that may compete directly with our own creative offerings.
If we are not able to provide products, services ad solutions that compete   effectively, we could   experience   reduced sales and our business   could be   adversely   affected.
Such uses may result in controversy or claims  related to   defamation,  rights of publicity, illegal  content; intellectual  property   infringement, harmful   content; misinformation and disinformation; harmful misappropriation, data privacy, derivative uses of third-party Al and personal injury torts If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created our products, services or solutions or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands.
Failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could disrupt our business operations and those of our customers, subject us to reputational harm, require costly and time-intensive notifications, and cause uS to lose customers, users and future business.
Occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments If a transition   among data centers or to third-party   service   providers  encounters  unexpected  interruptions, unforeseen complexity Or unplanned   disruptions despite precautions   undertaken  during the process, this may impair our delivery of products, services and solutions to customers and result in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results, reputation and our business.
Furthermore, our  ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic 0 customer websites We may also find, on occasion; that cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real-time due to factors such as significant spikes in customer activity o their websites o failures of our network Or software (or that of a third-party service provider).
If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer and user base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers O those of third parties, service outages Or performance issues could occur, which may impact our customers.
Such a strain 0n our infrastructure capacity may subject US to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments o financial liabilities and result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business If we supply materially inaccurate information O experience significant interruptions in our systems, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers and we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses Security incidents, improper access to or disclosure 0f our customers data or other cyber incidents may harm our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business Our  products,  services   and  solutions   collect,  store, manage  ad otherwise process   third-party   data,  including our customers data and our own data.
Such products, services and solutions as well as our technologies, systems and networks have been subject to, and may in the future be subject to, cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, fraud, worms, social  engineering, denial-of-service attacks, malicious software programs,  insider  threats  and other  cybersecurity incidents that have in the past, and may in the future, result in the unauthorized access, disclosure, acquisition, use, loss o destruction of sensitive personal or business data belonging to us and our customers.
Malicious actors may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our products, services and solutions, including unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards O other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service.
While we actively combat such  fraudulent activities, we have  experienced, and may in the future experience, impacts to our   revenue from such activities.
Further; unauthorized parties may also physical access to our facilities and infiltrate our information systems Or attempt to 25 we gain gain Table of Contents logical access to our products, services or information systems to access content and data: The loss of or unauthorized access to data, such as resulting from computer viruses, worms, ransomware Or other malware may harm our systems, expose uS to litigation o regulatory investigation and subject us to costly and time-intensive notification requirements.
Even if such breach is unrelated to our security systems, solutions or programs,  such breach   could cause us reputational  harm  and require us to incur  significant   economic  and operational consequences to adequately assess and respond to their breach, and to implement additional safeguards designed to protect against future breaches While we maintain insurance to cover operational risks, such as risk and technology outages, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liability described herein These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products, services and solutions and store and process more data.
We rely on third-party distribution platforms and are subject to changes in pricing structure, terms of service, privacy practices and other policies at the discretion of the platform provider: adverse changes to the terms with such third-party distribution platforms which we rely o to distribute our products, services and solutions may adversely affect our financial results.
Additionally, our distribution channels may not continue to market o sell our products, services and solutions effectively and may favor products, services and solutions of other companies.
We sell many products, services and solutions through our direct sales force.
Our business could be harmed if our direct sales expansion efforts do not generate the corresponding efficiencies and revenue we anticipated from such investment: In addition; the loss of sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees 26 cyber Any key Table of Contents We rely on third-party service providers and technologies to deliver our products, services and business operations and to operate   critical business   systems,  such as   cloud-based   infrastructure, data   center   facilities,  encryption   and  authentication technology and company email, communications with customers.
If such third parties are negatively affected, if we fail to effectively develop, manage and maintain our relationships with such third parties, or if we are unable to renew our agreements with them o favorable terms or at all, our expenses could significantly increase, and we and our customers may experience service interruptions disruption or damage Or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business.
Further, interruptions in our services caused by us or our third-party service providers may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against US or to terminate their subscriptions or contracts, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which may adversely affect our financial results.
Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.
Our customers spending rate and demand for our products, services and solutions may also be adversely affected by the above risks If our global sales are reduced, delayed o canceled because of any of the above risks, our revenue may decline.
Some 0f our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which may increase our costs and make our sales cycles unpredictable As we continue to target large enterprise customers for certain of our offerings, including Adobe Experience Cloud in our Digital Experience business and our Enterprise Term License Agreements in our Digital Media business, we may face increased costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing our sales For our enterprise customers, the evaluation process may be longer and more involved, and require us to invest more in educating Our customers about our products, services and solutions, particularly because the decision to use Our products, services and solutions is often an enterprise-wide decision: We may be required to submit more robust proposals, participate in extended proof-of-concept evaluation cycles and engage in more extensive contract negotiations.
In addition, our enterprise customers often demand more complex   configurations and additional integration services and product  features.
Due to these factors, we often must devote greater sales support to certain enterprise customers, which increases our costs and time required to complete a sale, without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions.
Our revenue from enterprise customers may be affected by longer-than- expected sales and implementation cycles, extended collection cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements.
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws and regulatory requirements could impact our business models and expose US to increased liability: We are subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that relate to our various business units and data processing activities, which may include sensitive, confidential, and personal  information.
Infringement Or misappropriation of such intellectual property could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value.
We protect our intellectual property by relying o federal, state and common law rights in the United States and internationally, as well as d variety of administrative procedures and contractual restrictions.
Despite Our efforts, protecting our intellectual property rights and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property are inherently difficult For instance, we actively combat software piracy, but we continue to lose revenue due to illegal use of our software.
Additionally, we are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex , protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding the validity o alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and personnel.
Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products, services o solutions, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements In addition, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights   for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual  obligations with our customers of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in various government sectors, including to obtain various security authorizations and certifications   Such processes are complex, lengthy and can often be delayed.
Furthermore, requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain oe or more government authorizations or certifications, which could affect our ability to sell to government entities until we meet any revised requirements Risks Related to Financial Performance If there is a change in subscriptions or renewals in a reporting period, this could cause our financial results to suffer and may not be immediately reflected in our revenue and financial results for that period because we recognize revenue over the subscription term.
Our offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and service agreements We generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months.
As a result; most of the subscription revenue we report each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters Lower sales and subscriptions, reduced demand for Our products, services ad solutions, ad increases in our attrition rate in any given period may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.
Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
Our renewal rates decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers " level of satisfaction, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, reliability of our offerings, prices of ours and competitors' offerings, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, changes as a result of regulatory or legal requirements, changes in the composition of our customer base and reductions in our customers spending levels or declines in customer activity.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if renew on terms less favorable to US, our revenue may decline.
If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may suffer and vary from those anticipated: We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.
For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise andlor o-device software licenses and cloud services.
Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may significant judgment: We have concluded that the on-premiselon-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not   distinct from each other   such that   revenue   from each   offering  should be  recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design Or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2023 For our fiscal 2023, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, driven by our innovative product roadmap.
As we execute o our long-term growth initiatives and deliver product innovation, we have continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings Digital Media In our Digital  Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our   subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences.

These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new and enhanced desktop, web and mobile apps, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud: Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs ) revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, collaborate, review approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type.

Digital Experience revenue was $4.89 billion in fiscal 2023, up from $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022 which represents 11% year-over-year  growth.
Driving  this   growth was the   increase   in   subscription   revenue, which  grew to $4.33 billion in fiscal 2023 from $3.88 billion in fiscal 2022, representing 12% year-over-year growth.
While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our  subscription-based business model, the broader  implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall   financial  position, particularly in the long term; remain uncertain.
See the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item IA of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business: Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2023 Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $15.17 billion as of December 1, 2023 increased by $1.91 billion, or 14%, from $13.26 billion as of December 2,2022.

Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2023 and 2022 which were 52-week years Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition Our  revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software   subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support.
Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers Revenue is recognized when a contract exists between uS and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products Or services We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be capable of distinct and accounted  for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud- enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Subscription, Product and Services Offerings We enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of our products, services and/or solutions as described above.
Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase other Adobe products or services.
57 doing for, being Table of Contents ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Fully hosted  subscription services (SaaS? )
allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual  term without taking possession of the software.
Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold o a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.
We recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term, which typically ranges from 1 to 36 months, for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term.
Revenue for subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.
When cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud- enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription for which the cloud-enabled services are provided The   subscription   support plans related to those customer  arrangements whose revenues we classify as   subscription revenues represent stand-ready performance obligations.
Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably over their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.
Licenses for o-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time O based on usage for certain of our original equipment manufacturer (OEM> and royalty agreements.
Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as product revenue 0 our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue from on-premise term license o term licensing arrangements with unilateral cancellation   rights or monthly  renewal options, and any  associated  maintenance   and  support, is   classified as subscription revenue.
Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a in time ad our advertising offerings We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis.
These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and- materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts.
Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the "as-invoiced" practical expedient: Judgments Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.
example, some of our offerings include both on-premise andlor o-device software licenses and cloud services.
Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment.
We have concluded that the on-premiselon-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not   distinct   from each  other  such that   revenue   from  each  offering   should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided.
Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling depending on factors such as where are sold and what channel are sold through: Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g,, the performance obligation is not sold separately) , we maximize the use of observable inputs by information that include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models Capitalized costs to obtain & contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit; which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length; renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year; we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient.
When revenue arrangements include components of third-party and services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment Or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, o an agent, and report revenues on a net basis  In this assessment; we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods Or services before are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the or services, which party has discretion in establishing and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction: We offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers   andlor   end-user customers.
This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing written notice to US of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term and consumers have a period of time to terminate certain agreements without penalty.
For certain of our usage-based license agreements, typically in our royalty and OEM businesses, reporting may be received after the end of a fiscal period In such instances, we estimate and accrue license revenue.
We do not estimate   variable consideration for our sales and usage-based license royalty agreements, consistent with the associated exception for sales and usage-based royalties for the license of intellectual property under the revenue recognition standard  Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization: Property and equipment are depreciated the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally as follows: 3 to 20 years for computers and other equipment, which includes our corporate jet, 5 years for furniture and fixtures, 15 years for building improvements and 35 years   for buildings  Leasehold improvements are amortized the   straight-line  method over the lesser of the remaining respective lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.
Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market; customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings A credit review is completed for our new distributors, dealers and OEMs We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and require letters of credit or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary.
In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit-worthiness of the agency' s customers in addition to the agency itself: If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customer' $ ability and intention to pay is not probable, the arrangement is not considered to be a revenue contract  Accordingly, we will not recognize any consideration received as revenue until termination or substantive completion of the services.
Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: Digital Media _Our  Digital Media   segment   provides   products and services   that enable   individuals,  teams, businesses, and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by transforming how view, share, engage   with and collaborate on documents   and creative content   Our customers include creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic ad experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; and consumers.

Our customers   include   marketers,  advertisers,  agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite.
Contract assets are typically related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction price allocated to the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of billings to date.
Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations Deferred revenue   primarily consists of   billings or   payments   received in advance   of revenue recognition from subscription   services, including  non-cancellable  and non-refundable   committed funds and  refindable   customer  deposits.
Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing; size and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component  The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing Our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers.

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized  which includes   deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as  revenue in future periods Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several   factors, including the timing of renewals and average contract term: We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales and usage-based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint Remaining performance obligations were approximately $17.22 billion as of December 1 2023 .
