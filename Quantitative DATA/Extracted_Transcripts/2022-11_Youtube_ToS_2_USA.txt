Our Service Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform.
YouTube enables access to certain premium features or content in exchange for one-time or recurring fees (each a "Paid Service").
The Paid Services include YouTube rentals and purchases, channel memberships, paid subscriptions, and other YouTube services which may be offered by Google.
1.2 Applicable Terms Your transactions and any use of the Paid Services are subject to: these Paid Service Terms of Service; the YouTube Terms of Service; the Paid Service Usage Rules; and the YouTube Community Guidelines.
Accessing Paid Services 2.1 Age Requirements The age requirements in the YouTube Terms of Service also apply to your use of the Paid Services.
There may also be limits on how you can access or use the different types of Paid Services on YouTube (e.g., applicable viewing periods and device limitations).
Please see the YouTube Paid Service Usage Rules for more information.
2.4 Other Google Paid Services In some cases, you may be able to access a Paid Service through other Google products (e.g., you may be able to watch a movie on Google Play that you purchased on YouTube).
Additionally, you may be able to access content via YouTube that you have purchased, or subscribed to, through other Google products (e.g.
you may be able to watch a movie on YouTube that you purchased on Google Play).
Your use of any Paid Service is governed only by the Terms, and not the terms of any other Google product, including any other Google product through which you receive access to a Paid Service.
Payment and Free Trials 3.1 Payment Google accepts payment via the payment method indicated prior to your purchase.
You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order.
Google will charge your payment method for the price listed for the relevant Paid Service along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations.
If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Service subscription, you agree that Google will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other reason, and Google is unable to charge you on the next billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Service until you update your payment method.
In some cases, you may transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Service (e.g., if you subscribe to YouTube Premium using another platform like Apple or Google Play).
3.2 Free Trials Google may offer free trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time.
If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that includes a trial, you will receive access to that Paid Service for the duration of the trial period.
To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period.
3.3 Discounts Google may, from time to time, offer discounts on purchases or subscriptions (such as a YouTube family plan or student plan).
4.3 Refunds Google offers additional rights of refund for several types of Paid Services, including digital content, as set out in the Refund Policy.
Your license to the Paid Services (including any content offered through the Paid Services) is non-exclusive and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Google and its licensors.
You agree not to use any Paid Service, in whole or in part, in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged (except where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement).
Restrictions When you use the Paid Services, you may not (or attempt to): use the Paid Services in an illegal manner, or for an illegal purpose; share your Google account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid Service they did not order; copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the Paid Services to any third party; circumvent, reverse engineer, modify, disable, or otherwise tamper with any security technology that Google uses to protect the Paid Services or encourage or help anyone else to do so; access the Paid Services other than by means authorized by Google; or remove any proprietary notices or labels on Paid Services (for example watermarks).

If we materially change the Paid Service Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice (except when we launch a new product or feature or in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements) and an opportunity to cancel any subscriptions.
The new terms will apply to your use of all Paid Service content (including content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases.
