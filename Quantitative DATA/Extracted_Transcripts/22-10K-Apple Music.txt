Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.
The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.
The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7 Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.
In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.
Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.
The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.
When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.
For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store.
These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.
This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services.
Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content.
Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.
The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.
Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.
The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors.
Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device.
Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11 The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis.
These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.
The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.
