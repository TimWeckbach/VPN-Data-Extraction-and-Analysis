Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7 Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.
In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.
Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9 The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.
The Company believes that third-party developer support depends on the perceived benefits of creating software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.
When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.
This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services.
Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content.
Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.
The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.
Resellers offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of devices, and such plans may be discontinued or modified any time.
For example, the Company has implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari® in the EU as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces for developers.
