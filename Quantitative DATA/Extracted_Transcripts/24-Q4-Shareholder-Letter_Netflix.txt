In Q4, membership growth was driven by broad strength across our content slate, improved product/market fit across all regions and typical Q4 seasonality.
We estimate there are now 750M+ broadband households (excluding China and Russia) and $650B+4 of entertainment revenue in the markets we operate in, of which we only captured ~6% in 2024.
Similarly, we believe we account for less than 10% of TV viewing in every country in which we operate, all of which suggests a long runway for growth as streaming continues to expand around the world.
We have to continue to improve all aspects of Netflix - more series and films our members love, a great product experience, increased sophistication in our plans and pricing strategy (including more advertising capabilities) - and grow into new areas like live programming and games.
Content We want to be the first place members go for entertainment - whatever your taste or mood, and whomever you are watching with.
Engagement underpins that goal, as we believe it is the best proxy for customer satisfaction, which in turn leads to higher retention, acquisition and value for our service.

5 Nielsen’s Streaming TV Top 10 3 With over 300M paid memberships (which excludes Extra Member accounts) and multiple people per household, we’re entertaining a massive global audience estimated at over 700M.
We work to constantly improve our content offering.
We publish our top titles based on views each week at Netflix Top 10.
While we started in mobile, our goal is to make our games accessible on all device types over time and in 2025 we’ll continue to test and expand our offering of cloud games on TV.
For example, our ads plan allows us to offer lower price points for consumers, which continues to be quite popular.
In Q4, it accounted for over 55% of sign-ups in our ads countries and membership on our ads plan grew nearly 30% quarter over quarter.
Today we are introducing an Extra Member with Ads offering in 10 of the 12 countries where we have an ads plan to give our members additional choice and flexibility.
We’re on track to reach sufficient scale for ads members in all of our ads countries in 2025.
A top priority in 2025 is to improve our offering for advertisers so that we can substantially grow our advertising 5 revenue.
In November, we rolled out our first party ad tech platform in Canada and we’ve now fully transitioned all ad serving in Canada in-house.
Over time, our ad tech platform will allow us to better deliver critical capabilities to advertisers including expanded programmatic availability, enhanced targeting and additional measurement and reporting.
The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and engage and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for consumer engagement with different modes of entertainment; failing to improve the variety and quality of entertainment offerings; adoption of the ads plan and paid sharing; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; macroeconomic conditions; content slate and timing of content releases.
