\section{Classification Results}
\label{sec:classification_results}

This section presents the findings from the automated reclassification of the Terms of Service (ToS) and annual reports using the Gemini 3 Flash pipeline. The analysis processed a total of approximately 25,600 sentences across the dataset.

\subsection{Distribution of Enforcement Categories}
The classification revealed a significant dominance of ``General Terms'' within the corpus, with approximately \textbf{91\%} of the processed sentences identified as legal boilerplate. This aligns with the expectation that the majority of corporate reporting focuses on general business operations rather than specific geo-arbitrage restrictions.

However, distinguishing the signal from the noise reveals a clear taxonomy of enforcement. The following distribution (see Table \ref{tab:category_dist}) highlights the varying approaches of digital service providers.

        \toprule
        \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Frequency} \\
        \midrule
        Content Licensing & Geographic restrictions based on IP rights. & 857 \\
        Regulatory Compliance & Compliance with local laws and regulations. & 743 \\
        Account Action & Punitive measures (suspension, termination) for violations. & 280 \\
        Price Discrimination & Explicit mentions of regional pricing differences. & 197 \\
        Technical Blocking & Measures to detect/block VPNs, proxies, and IP masking. & 106 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}

\subsection{Service-Specific Analysis}
The enforcement strategies vary significantly across different service providers, reflecting their distinct business models and regional licensing constraints. Figure \ref{fig:service_dist} illustrates the proportional distribution of categories for each service. 
Notably, services with heavy reliance on third-party content licensing exhibit a higher proportion of \textit{Content Licensing} and \textit{Technical Blocking} clauses. In contrast, platforms with global dynamic pricing models show a stronger emphasis on \textit{Price Discrimination} and \textit{Account Action} to prevent arbitrage.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal Evolution of Enforcement}
To understand how these strategies have evolved over time, we analyzed the frequency of category specific clauses across the dataset's years. Figure \ref{fig:timeline_all} shows the aggregate trend, while Figure \ref{fig:timeline_service} breaks this down by service provider.

The aggregate data reveals a clear upward trend in specific enforcement clauses, particularly starting from 2022. This correlates with the increased global awareness of digital price arbitrage and the deployment of more sophisticated VPN detection technologies. The "cat-and-mouse" dynamic is evident in the data, where waves of new restrictive clauses often follow periods of increased user workaround activity.

\end{figure}

\subsection{High-Confidence Findings: The "Smoking Gun" Clauses}
The Gemini 3 Flash model identified specific, high-confidence clauses that serve as the "teeth" of the coercive strategy. For example, clauses explicitly stating "You may not use any technology to obscure or disguise your location" were consistently categorized as \textit{Technical Blocking} with $>0.95$ confidence. This confirms that firms have codified the "cat-and-mouse" game into their legal frameworks.

\section{The Digital Services Price Index (DSPI)}
\label{sec:dspi_results}

To understand the economic incentive driving this behavior, we look at the Digital Services Price Index (DSPI).

\subsection{Magnitude of the Arbitrage Incentive}
The data (derived from Phase 1 sampling) indicates a massive disparity between markets. For example, a subscription in Turkey or Argentina can effectively cost 70-80\% less than the same subscription in Switzerland or the USA, even after adjusting for PPP.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \end{minipage}}
    \caption{Global Heatmap of Digital Service Pricing (The DSPI)}
    \label{fig:dspi_map}
\end{figure}

This disparity creates a "super-normal" profit margin for the consumer-arbitrageur, which explains the high persistence of the behavior despite the technical barriers described in Section \ref{sec:classification_results}.
