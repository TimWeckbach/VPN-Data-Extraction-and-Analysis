This chapter details how the research will be conducted.

To operationalize the 'Coercive' and 'Technical Barrier' constructs, this study employs the 'Litigious' and 'Constraining' word lists developed by Loughran and McDonald (2011), which are the established standard for detecting legal risk and restriction in financial texts.

\section{Research Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A mixed-methods approach is used.
    \item Combines quantitative analysis (to build and test the DSPI) with qualitative analysis (to understand strategic responses).
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase 1: Quantitative Data Collection \& Analysis (for RQ1)}

\subsection{Data Collection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of the Digital Services Price Index (DSPI).
    \item Service Selection: Streaming, SaaS, gaming.
    \item Country Selection: High-, middle-, and low-income countries.
    \item Method: VPN-controlled price sampling.
    \item Data Points: Price, currency, and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalization of prices across different currencies and markets.
    \item Calculation of the DSPI.
    \item Statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA, regression) to identify patterns and drivers of price differentiation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase 2: Qualitative Data Collection \& Analysis (for RQ2)}

\subsection{Qualitative Data Collection \& Analysis}
The analysis follows a systematic coding approach inspired by the \textbf{Gioia Methodology} \parencite{gioia2013seeking}. This involves structuring data into 1st-order concepts (raw terms found in text), 2nd-order themes (theoretical categories like "Technical Blocking"), and aggregate dimensions (Strategic Responses).
While initially conceptualized for manual coding \parencite{duriau2007content}, this hierarchical structure provided the logic for the automated classification pipeline described below.

\subsection{Standard Qualitative Coding}
In addition to the automated pipeline, manual qualitative coding is applied to a sub-sample to capture themes that escape rigid categorization, such as the specific "tone" of VPN provider marketing (e.g., empowering vs. technical).
